[Tannin](/characters/tannin/) suggests a Predator-style takedown of Typhis with traps, etc. Meanwhile, [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) takes the position of “no side quests” and advocates for the party to move on. 

We settle on setting some traps to get Typhis when he inevitably returns from the desert (when the Suggestion wears off). Tannin thinks awhile on what Typhis’s weaknesses might be, helped by the Guidance of [Istus](/characters/istus/) and Bardic Inspiration. He believes Tyhpis to be a marid—a genie from the water plane. They have the ability to summon and control Elementals, the ability to take on a gaseous form (as we saw), and this one seems to be amassing an army. They are native to the Elemental Plane of Water, of course. They are generally resistant to acid, cold, and lightning, as are many in the Elemental Plane of Water.

Tannin also has Beast Sense—he can see and hear through a willing creature. We fly Zotz out as a scout to do some reconnaisance to avoid splitting the party. 

We decide that the plan will be for [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) to use the quiznos on Typhis when he returns, in the hopes of Banishing him back to his native plane.

Zotz returns, and Tannin reports: Typhis is having a moment in the desert where he thinks “Wait… why am I doing this?” and turns around. His whole crew, a living river, starts back toward the forest lake.

As Typhis comes within range, Fibsy prepares an action to use fire bolts. Hanamir waits for him to come within 60 feet, and then casts Banishment with the quiznos. However, Typhis passes his save—barely. He struggles and persists in his hold on the material plane. Then Hanamir flies to a tree and hides. Fibsy’s fire bolts are launched, along with his Eldritch Cannon. The bolts miss, but the cannon does 7 damage. Fibsy then backs away to stay at range.

Tannin, cursing under his breath, reminds himself that he needs to get some ranged weapons in Peloria. He starts running at Typhis. While running, he drinks a potion of Heroism, which gives him 10 temporary HP and Bless for one hour. “Now’s the time! Free yourselves! Fight! Fight if you can! Typhis ensnares you in this plane!” he cries to the water Elementals. 

Harlan casts Bless on the main fighters of the party: Tannin, Hanamir, and [Chunk](/characters/chunk/). As a bonus action, he casts Spiritual Weapon to summon a giant book. 

[Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) casts Fireball at Typhis, but he passes his save and only takes 16 damage. However, three water Elementals around him take the full blast of 33 damage each. 

Chunk casts Lightning at 5th level and does 21 damage to Typhis.

Typhis appears to be standing on a surfboard, riding a wave made of water Elementals toward us. He shoots a jet of water straight at Tannin, and it also hits Chunk and Fibsy behind him. But each of them is able to jump out of the way, only taking 8 damage each. 

The front four water Elementals under Typhis’s command make up the wave that he’s riding. 

Fibsy casts Scorching Ray on Typhis, which emanates out in 3 rays, each of which hits successfully. The Eldritch Cannon fires again, doing some solid damage.

Hanamir tries the quiznos again, but it fails again. He flies to another tree and hides. The quiznos is now out of charges for the day.

Tannin prepares an action: he’s going to throw down a feather token, which creates a tree—a big old oak tree. He’s pretending to be readying a trident attack, but when he gets close enough, Tyhpis is gonna hit the tree instead, Wile E. Coyote style! Tannin will then spring into the air and be on the tree, to then attack with the trident.

This… works! Really well! Typhis gets knocked off his wave, and lies prone on the ground. He takes 16 damage. The tree keeps growing, with Tannin on top of it. 

Harlan’s Spiritual Weapon (a giant book) claps closed on Typhis and does 12 damage.

Galadriel casts Crush Mind. Typhis, already weakened and prone, fails the save and takes 31 psychic damage. 

We now have the front four water Elementals within range (they had formed the wave Typhis was surfing). One comes for Fibsy, one for Tannin, one for Galadriel, and one for Chunk. Each must make a strength save, and each of us passes! The water was trying to knock us down, but we all stayed steady. 

Typhis makes a double trident attack on Chunk, but fails both. All of these water Elementals seem off their game after Tannin’s tree attack.
