*Earlier*

It’s strange, [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) thinks, to be traveling alone again. He’s grown accustomed to the background noises of his friends during their walks across the continent: [Hermione](/characters/hermione/) exclaiming over an interesting species of demonfly, or [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) spinning his trident like a baton and then dropping it, cursing, or [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/)’s distracted lute-strumming. But today, the trek out of Aberith to Elris’s farm is quiet except for the sound of his own boots on the damp and sand-flecked soil. 

Just as the oversized barn emerges on the horizon, Harlan hears a familiar screech. He smiles to himself. Out in a field of grazing aurochs, large blue humanoid—a *firbolg*, if he’s remembering correctly—pats Zotz on the nose.

The bat is noticeably calmer than Harlan remembers. As he approaches, the caretaker feeds Zotz a giant moth.

“Good boy, Zotz!” 

Harlan jogs ahead and waves to get his attention. The firbolg, a young man with a fluffy pair of sideburns, waves back with a surprising level of enthusiasm.

“You must be Mr. Stormborne!” he calls. “Just wait here, I’ll go get my dad.”

He lopes over to the farmhouse and returns moments later with Elris. The old farmer grins at the sight of Harlan’s wonder at Zotz’s improved behavior. 

“He’s so calm!” says Harlan. “It’s a miracle what you’ve done with him.” He reaches out with a pouch of coins for Elris to take. “I’ll be honest, this doesn’t seem like enough.”

“Ah, shucks, many thanks to you,” says Elris. “For your kind words as well as your payment.” He pauses. “You know, I did have a favor I was meaning to ask of you, if you’re open to it.”

“Of course,” says Harlan.

“Now, I’ve trained one of yours,” says Elris, “so I was hoping maybe you’d train one of mine.” 

He indicates the younger firbolg beside him. 

“This is my boy. He’s great around the farm, and he has quite a way with your bat, there, as you’ve seen. But he’s a little soft, and he ain’t seen much of the world. I figure if he was to tag along with an adventuring fellow like yourself, he’d learn some fine life skills and come back the better for it. What do you say to that?”

“I’d be happy to have an apprentice, not to mention an expert in bat care,” says Harlan. He turns to the boy, craning his neck a bit to look up at him. “What’s your name, then?”

“Well, my name is Elris Vasquin the Third,” says the young giant, in a voice almost as soft as the featherweed pasture beneath him, “but everybody calls me [Chunk](/characters/chunk/).” He chuckles, but doesn’t explain. “I mostly tend to the plants and look after the creatures here on the farm.”

“And he’s mighty strong,” adds Elris. “Could be a helpful squire, or something like that.”

“Certainly he could,” says Harlan deferentially. “Well... all right. I’m traveling with some companions in Aberith and we have important business to attend to. I’ll be heading back to the city with Zotz after this. Ever been to the city, Chunk?”

“No, sir.”

*Now*

The river that separates upper Aberith from lower Aberith is disarmingly strong, and the icy current threatens to pull [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/)’s head beneath its surface more than once. It’s only his training in monastic breathwork, he thinks—along with his admittedly impressive core strength—that’s keeping him afloat. 

Out of the corner of his eye, he spots a floating object behind him—another person? Hanamir squints. Yes, that’s a soaking, bearded head bobbing along a few yards away. No, not just bobbing along; it’s gaining on him, and fast. 

“Oh! Hey!” calls Tannin, spitting out a mouthful of river water. “What are you doing here?”

“I got caught by the Amber Guard trying to sneak into [Kandir](/characters/kandir/)’s house,” says Hanamir. He takes a few wide strokes, already struggling to keep up with the mer-dwarf.

“HA!” says Tannin. He punches the water, and Hanamir is hit with a bracingly cold splash. “Bust any heads?!”

“Not yet, I’m afraid,” says Hanamir. He shakes it off. “How’s your day going?”

“Well, I got my hand back!” Tannin waves a leftie, proudly. “But it was more expensive than Harlan’s was. I don’t think the priest chick likes my sense of humor.” He shrugs, mid-stroke. “So I was going to see if [Mirama](/characters/mirama/) was up and maybe could spare some gold to cover the extra, but then that huge explosion happened!” Tannin mimes it with his hands, splashing another wave of river water at Hanamir’s face for dramatic effect. “Did you see that?”

“I did,” says Hanamir, now actively seeking a point on the shoreline from which to pull himself out.

“So I jumped into the river, since it seems to be going that way,” says Tannin. “You doing the same?”

“I’m actually planning on heading back to Kandir’s, now that I’ve lost those guards,” says Hanamir. He grabs hold of a branch from a heavily-bowed tree and begins climbing toward land. “Galadriel is still there, and she might need help.”

“OK!” shouts Tannin, already almost out of earshot, swimming toward the area of sky dense with smoke and flickering firelight. “Good luck, dude!”

Hermione passes throngs of people running in the opposite direction as she makes her way out of the Kiln toward the large southeastern neighborhood labeled on her map as “the Flats.”

“Hey, lady!” shouts a teenaged human as she bumps into him on the crowded street. “You’re going the wrong way, you know that?!”

“Do you know what happened?” she shouts back to him, but he has already run past her, and doesn’t look back. 

The closer she gets to the Flats, the more difficult it is to take in the chaos around her. Buildings just outside the blast radius are swallowed in flames, while the perimeter of the explosion itself is eerily still. From what Hermione can tell, the disaster area itself encompasses dozens of city blocks, all flattened, or perhaps *melted*, leaving nothing behind but a layer of shiny, black glass on the ground, stretching out into the smoky night.

At the edge of this crater, she spots an anomaly: a short, loincloth-clad man bearing a trident, who is, unlike anyone else in this scene, soaking wet and actively dripping water on the ground.

“Hey! Tannin!” she cries, waving her hands at him through the smoke. “Do you know what happened here?”

“No,” says Tannin. “Do you?”

“No!” says Hermione. “But I figured I’d run into at least a couple of you if I went toward the danger.”

Sure enough, they hear Zotz’s telltale screech from behind them just a moment later, and Harlan appears, accompanied by a very tall, blue-complected young man leading the bat on a comically large leash.

“Hermione! Tannin!” Harlan calls. “I just got back—what’s going on?!” He smacks his forehead. “How rude of me—Chunk, this is Hermione, and this is Tannin, our wizard and our barbarian, respectively—Hermione and Tannin, this is Chunk, he’s Elris’s son and now he’s my apprentice—”

“I reckon it’d be a pleasure to meet y’all if it weren’t for this here disaster,” says Chunk mournfully. 

“Well said,” says Hermione, with a curt nod. “We’ll have to get to know each other later, Chunk. I’m going to try and get a bird’s eye view of the crater.”

Hermione conjures a nest of blue light in one hand, circling it with her other palm until it takes form, like a pot on a spinner’s wheel. In a moment, a live hawk appears inside the nest. It shakes its feathers, and wisps of blue energy fall to the ground and disappear, leaving a streak of light in the air as it takes flight from her hand.

“It’s… terrible,” she says. “It’s an entire tenth of the city, gone.” She pauses. Above them, the hawk makes a wide circle through the sky. “There’s an origin point at the center. Looks like an impact from above.” 

“Anything else you can see? Clues about who, or what, did this?” says Harlan.

“It’s like nothing I’ve ever seen,” she says. “I don’t know of any individual who could do something like this, magically or otherwise...” she trails off, but then seems to spot something. “Actually,” she says, her voice quickening, “to the south, there are three people, and maybe they’re just fleeing like everyone else, but they’re moving fast, and wearing masks—”

Harlan quickly detaches the leash from Zotz’s collar and pats his flank.

“On it,” says Harlan. He jumps up onto the bat’s back without facing any resistance. “Wow, Zotz. Time to show off your new skills, okay, buddy?”

Without needing to be asked, Zotz launches into flight with a forceful beat of his wings. 

“You guys follow us from the ground, and we can confront them together,” Harlan calls down.

“I’m going to get closer to the impact,” Hermione calls back. She dismisses her hawk and starts walking toward the crater’s edge. “Tannin, Chunk, you two follow Harlan and back him up. Meet back at the Flagon later.”

Chunk’s height gives him a better vantage point to keep track of Zotz flying through the smoky evening sky. Tannin has to break into a full sprint in order to keep up with Chunk’s jogging pace.

“Want a lift?” Chunk calls down to him as they turn off a main road onto a quieter residential street.

“Appreciate it, kid, but I think we’ve already got ‘em,” says Tannin, pointing down the street to where Harlan has landed Zotz and is blocking the three suspects’ progress.

“Halt!” says Harlan. “In the name of King [Slee](/characters/slee/), you are under arrest!”

His bravado is unable to persuade the suspects to surrender, however, and they turn back, only to discover that Tannin has flown into a barbarian rage. He knocks one of them cold onto the street in one punch. 

Harlan follows up with a swing of his hammer that is perhaps too strong, hitting a second one so hard he appears to be dead. 

The third one puts his hands up and allows Chunk to restrain him.

“I’m used to wrasslin’ hogs on the farm!” Chunk notes.

Hanamir arrives back at Kandir’s house and sees more Amber Guardsmen running in the direction of the explosion. Despite being soaking wet from the river, he has no trouble sneaking inside the house unnoticed. 

He hears Galadriel’s voice cursing from rooms away. He finds her in the kitchen, hanging up several cast-iron pots and pans she evidently knocked over on her own trip through a window.

“Oh, thank goodness it’s you!” she starts, when she notices Hanamir. “I came in and knocked over all these—really not doing great—but the explosion seems to have distracted everyone for now—”

Hanamir helps her hang the last couple pans back up.

“Yes, the explosion is an unfortunate boon to our mission,” he says. “Where should we start?” 

“His office, maybe?” says Galadriel. “Anywhere he might keep important papers.”

They tiptoe down the hall to a small room with bookshelves and a desk. In one of the drawers, they find an odd assortment of private papers: clippings from newspapers, collected reports, top-secret intelligence, all seemingly about Aberith’s Anti-Magic League. There are several profiles of important people within the AML. 

“Should we take this?” asks Galadriel.

“No, I think not,” says Hanamir. “Let’s keep looking.”

They continue down the hallway and up a flight of stairs. Galadriel notices that despite being soggy from his jump in the river, his feet are not leaving wet tracks on the polished hardwood. 

“Hey, is that a spell?” she asks him. “Are spells working in here?”

“Aha,” says Hanamir. “These are my Boots of False Tracks,” he explains. “I have them set to ‘barefoot female tiefling’ at the moment. And yes, they are magical, and appear to be working beautifully within the confines of Kandir’s home.”

Galadriel tries spider climbing a wall. She reaches the ceiling and rests a cheek against it.

“All right, Kandir,” she says. “Ban magic outside, but keep it in your own house. I see how it is.”

She creeps along the ceiling to another door along the hallway and goes in. A bathroom. 

“A crystal toilet? Why?” her voice echoes slightly off the marble countertops.

“There’s a lot of wealth in this house, I think,” says Hanamir. He peeks into what seems to be Kandir’s bedroom. Galadriel joins him, having found nothing of interest in the bathroom.

“He keeps it all very clean in here,” says Galadriel. “Or else he has someone cleaning this place nightly. But hey, a letter.” She picks up a piece of parchment off of his nightstand. “It’s from Jao Vedit!” she hisses. Hanamir reads over her shoulder.

“A thank-you note for a financial favor, it sounds like,” muses Hanamir. “Dated… five days ago. All right. This may be the most compromising item we’ll find.” He pauses, cupping a hand to his ear, then shakes his head. “Maybe we should go now.”

“Ah, but there’s a library!” whispers Galadriel. “Maybe there’ll be some weird, incriminating books in there…” 

They enter, and on a table in the center of the room sits a gilded bird cage with a small, chirping bird inside: yellow with black wings. Hanamir tries to disguise his anger.

“A spy, most likely,” he says. “And it’s seen us now.”

“Should we steal it?” says Galadriel.

“How would that help?”

“I don’t know, I’ll cover its eyes, and we can question it—” 

The sound of a door slamming somewhere down the hall makes them both jump. 

“Amber Guard! Freeze!” comes a muffled voice, along with boots making heavy footfalls up the stairs. 

Galadriel swings open the cage’s door, grabs the bird, and stuffs it in her satchel. 

“I’m sorry, Hanamir,” says Galadriel. “We should have left when you suggested it.”

“No, no,” says Hanamir. “Don’t count us out yet.”

With the footsteps rapidly approaching, Hanamir pops open his bottle of Everlasting Smoke, filling the room with cinnamon-scented smoke. Then he kicks a window open.

“After you,” he says.

Galadriel spider-climbs carefully out of the jagged glass opening and clings to the exterior wall of Kandir’s house. The bird chirps wildly in her satchel. 

The guards enter the smoky room. Without laying eyes on any intruders, someone casts Thunderwave into the library, and Hanamir, who has already climbed partway through the broken window, is blasted out into the night air. He uses Slow Fall and lands on his feet, unharmed except for a few glass shards sticking out from his skin.

“I have the quiznos, so I’m going to move quickly,” says Hanamir. “Meet you back at the Half-Full Flagon.” 

With a burst of speed, he sprints ahead of Galadriel. She nods and does a few awesome capoeira moves to avoid a flurry of arrows raining down at her from the broken library window.
