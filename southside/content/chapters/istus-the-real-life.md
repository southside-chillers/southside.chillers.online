# Vedit, Vedit suspicious

How much time has passed? We are not sure. The season has changed; it had been early spring when we left, and now it's more like early summer. It seems that in the Feywild, time passes in a different way than on the material plane. 

We approach the military garrison at the outskirts of Aberith. [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) attempts to sashay past them confidently, but is stopped.

**Guard:** Hold on, ma'am. What is your purpose in the city?

**Galadriel:** Hail, good sir. We are close personal friends of King [Slee](/characters/slee/) and we have important business to attend to with him.

The guard uses a sending stone to ask for direction from some higher authority. The sending stone crackles with a voice that says "Hold them."

**Guard:** Wait here.

**Galadriel:** Might I ask the nature of the current troubles in Aberith?

**Guard:** Just a couple of internal threats. We believe we have found the culprit in the previous assault on the city. We will have Vedit come see you.

This guy seems like he’s following orders and has nothing against us in particular. He's cheerful, but not super forthcoming.

In a few minutes, Vedit arrives. (Jao Vedit is the head of the Amber Guard, and is now Minister of War, succeeding [Pouru](/characters/pouru/) after her execution. We suspect that he is compromised by [Kandir](/characters/kandir/) somehow—in [Chapter 41](/chapters/split-party-soup), we found evidence that Kandir did a financial favor for him.) He seems to recognize us. After greeting us, he explains that we cannot meet with Slee.

**Vedit:** The king has been moved to a secure location, so you cannot see him now. The city is on lockdown, and we can't take any chances, even with people deemed trustworthy, as a member of the nobility was found responsible for the attack on the Flats.

**Galadriel:** Are there any further details you can give us about this person and the nature of this conspiracy? We’ve been tracking a group with noble connections ourselves.

**Vedit:** I cannot comment on the ongoing investigation. We’re being especially cautious.  We can let you into the city, but we can’t get you an audience with the king right now.

[**Harlan](/characters/harlan/):** Understood. Would it be possible for us to speak with others on the council? Mr. Kandir or Ms. [Mirama](/characters/mirama/)?

**Vedit:** Potentially. Mr. Kandir is quite busy with the investigation at the moment, but Ms. Mirama might be able to speak to you.

[**Tannin](/characters/tannin/):** That’s good enough for me. Let’s go.

**Galadriel:** Yes, thank you very much.

[**Chunk](/characters/chunk/):** The city is on lockdown… does that mean martial law? 

- No, it's not that strict, but comings and goings are monitored.
- There's no fighting in the streets or rioting or anything.
- Vedit says they're just trying to root out the other co-conspirators of the explosion attack.

Tannin gets up next to Vedit as he leads us through the gates of the city.

**Tannin:** So, is it Goldpeak?

Jao grabs him, wide-eyed.

**Vedit:** Quiet!

He pauses.

**Vedit:** But... yes! How did you know that?!

**Chunk:** We don't know that many nobles.

**Tannin:** Well *I* know tons of nobles, and I just got a sense about that one.

- He is clearly bullshitting.

**Vedit:** Well, don't leave the city. We may need to interview you to get a better understanding of what you've seen.

We assure him we won't, and that we're happy to talk whenever he's ready to loop us in.

**Harlan:** So, do we believe Goldpeak did it?

**Galadriel:** Well, he was *going* to be involved with the clowns, but he backed out from financing their mission for the three-sided coin. He could've been playing us, but my instinct says he's innocent.

[**Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/):** Yes. He's their fall guy, because he backed out of the deal.

**Harlan:** Sounds like we need to investigate.

**Tannin:** *(smugly)* Tannin's forte!

# Monastic spy network

Upon entering the city, we first go to the bait and tackle shop in the Kiln underneath which is the secret half-orc monastery Hanamir founded. It's yet more evidence of a longer time shift than expected: the monastery is thriving. It's operating as a sort of spy network of half-orc youths with newfound martial arts training; it's a real fight club.

Hanamir finds his lieutenant, a one-eyed fisherwoman named Left Eye (her right eye was stabbed out in a fishing accident), and asks her for an update.

**Left Eye:** As you know, things were tense in the city for a long time after the explosion. The dam broke two weeks ago when there was a big spectacle made of arresting Goldpeak. The army surrounded his manor. For such a dangerous man, he seemed fairly caught off guard by it all. Everyone was hoping for a big showdown, but he was dragged out of his house in manacles. The Amber Guard put a protective shield around him so he couldn’t cast any spells—they're assuming he's a powerful mage. He's charged with using magic to destroy the Flats, as well as of facilitating a plot to overthrow King Slee.

**Hanamir:** What evidence is there of this plot?

**Left Eye:** That's unclear. But King Slee has not been seen since. It is rumored that he was moved somewhere to be safe until the rest of Goldpeak’s network of conspirators has been rooted out. Vedit has been the most public face of this operation, and has been makig official announcements to the city. The rumor we heard was that a member of the Amber Guard happened upon some financial documents that linked Goldpeak to purchases of rare artifacts… some kind of merchandise that was being moved that they think is responsible for what happened. Some of his other associates have already been found, but they think there are more. A bunch of rich people.

**Hanamir:** Good work. Thank you.

Hanamir then procures the Amber Guard sending stone that we picked up after the fight in [Chapter 45](/chapters/fire-in-the-kiln). He references a meditation exercise where you stay silent and still for as long as possible.

**Hanamir:** Here’s what I want you to do. Keep this secret and safe somewhere in the monastery. When you train in silence, do it in the room with this stone, and if you hear anything come out of it, write it down. I’ll come back. I don’t have any money for you this time, but I will bring you more when I can.

Left Eye nods.

**Hanamir:** Stay safe and look lively. I’ll see you again soon.

# ...or Istus Just Fantasy?

We then go in search of a temple of Istus. There’s a small Istus temple on the northern side of the city. It's the nice part of town, but this temple is a modest place given that it serves one of the higher deities in the pantheon. It’s filled with books—Hanamir loves it—and it’s more like a fancy library than to a typical temple. Harlan finds it peculiar, since he’s used to the lavish cathedrals of [Kord](/characters/kord/).

There, he meets the head of the temple, whose name is Lady Bright. She greets him and says that she had a vision that he would be coming. She has something for him. She hands him an emblem of Istus: a small wheel, like one for spinning thread, that he can wear.

**Bright:** But I must ask that you not make your connection to Istus too widely known. As an adventurer, your exploits might further damage the reputation of the already ailing church of Istus.

**Harlan:** Of course. I am presenting myself humbly as a new adherent, and I respect your wishes. Especially since we are dedicated to the gathering of knowledge, and not the dissemination of it. Right? Also, is there any kind of welcome packet you might have?

**Bright:** There’s a pamphlet I can give you. 

**Harlan:** Great. I’d expect there to be plenty of reading material on Istus, and I’d like to get the to-go version of that.

Bright gives him a pamphlet titled *So, You’re Going to Be an Istus Cleric!*

**Harlan:** Thank you. Out of curiosity, why is the church of Istus 'ailing', as you put it?

**Bright:** The sudden decrease in popularity came a few years ago. We haven’t been evangelizing much since then, so our numbers have dropped.

**Harlan:** What was the cause?

**Bright:** The backlash against the gods hit Istus first and hardest. The people who resent the gods for being corrupt or playing with humans’ fates made Istus their target, and they were pretty successful. Followers of Istus became distrusted. And then the reputation started to spread to other gods. Nobody had an unkind word to say about Pelor or Kord… until they did.

**Harlan:** So was this all started by the Messenger?

**Bright:** He directly preached against Istus in the city for quite some time. I engaged him in a debate at one point, years ago.

**Harlan:** So you’ve met him!

**Bright:** Yes, in the public square.

**Harlan:** What was your impression of him?

**Bright:** Of course, he’s a zealot. But he has an agenda he’s pushing that is very attractive and hard to counter. No matter what I said, his followers grew in number. Their main argument is that Istus is the goddess of fate, and if she’s all knowing of past, present, and future, she should not allow bad things to happen. 'Why didn’t you warn us' is the common refrain to followers of Istus. I'm sure I don’t have to explain to *you* why non-intervention is our policy, but you get it.

**Harlan:** At the cosmic scale, who are Istus’s enemies?

**Bright:** The closest thing the gods have to rivals are others from their domain. Boccob is a neutral god in the knowledge domain, creator of magic. But there’s not a direct equivalent of Istus in the known pantheon on, say, the chaotic evil side, or something.

**Harlan:** Do we maintain any powerful connections? Any preferential treatment with institutions of learning in the city? 

**Bright:** No. And the church has been shut out of official city business at this point. The public doesn’t want anything in its government assocated with Istus.

**Harlan:** Well, then. I will keep my holy symbol hidden. Thank you.

# Mirama-rama

We go to Mirama’s next, and we are invited into her office.

**Mirama:** Glad to see you all safe. I haven’t heard from you in months.

**Tannin:** Well, we’ve been busy. It looks like you’re pretty busy too.

**Mirama:** Yes, there’s been a major break in the case, as I'm sure you've heard. The Amber Guard discovered a lead, and we’ve been chasing these conspirators down. The evidence suggests the network is vast.

**Tannin:** I dunno. Do you really think it's Goldpeak? We talked to him a lot. He was after artifacts for sure, but just for interest and prestige’s sake. He’s just a rich collector. He’s not masterminding to take over the government. Do you really believe this stuff? Even if they did find references to him in the Kiln… that's not so crazy.

**Mirama:** Men with power are rarely satisfied with the power they have. He's a powerful man; there are few more powerful in Aberith. Maybe only one, in fact. For him to set his eyes on that office makes some kind of sense.

**Tannin:** Guess so. But... are you sure? Do you have the murder weapon ? Like, the artifact that did the explosion?

**Mirama:** No, not yet. That’s one of the reasons the king has been moved.

**Tannin:** I dunno, Kir. This sounds like you’re just pinning this on him for convenience’s sake.

- He's not really trying to convince her, just make her think about it a little. He’s used to collaborating with her, asking her what she thinks, and offering his opinion, etc.
- She considers it, as she does trust him a lot.

**Mirama:** We’re trying to do this right. The Amber Guard is including us in this investigation, which is more than I hoped for. I have to say, what we’ve found so far does suggest that there’s a vast network, and I don’t know who else would have the resources to build such a thing if not Goldpeak. We have found several members so far, and have confessions from them, and documentation… the network is real, and we haven’t been able to question Goldpeak, but…

**Tannin:** Have you found any overlap between the network you discovered and the clown organization we discovered?

**Mirama:** We haven’t found clown uniforms on any of these people, or something like that. But it does seem like maybe they were operating in the same manner. My suspicion is that it is the same group. We have someone in custody who made a payment on a property that was burned that we know was a hub of activity for these people. 

- This is likely a reference to the safehouse from [Chapter 45](chapters/fire-in-the-kiln/).

**Tannin:** This is bigger than Goldpeak, though. This network has armies in other planes. Galadriel has been there! She can tell you.

**Galadriel:** Yes. It was the night we were at Goldpeak’s manor for his art gala. I had the opportunity to speak with one of these clowns. He took my hand and plane shifted me to the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna, and showed me a massive army the likes of which I’ve never seen before. Comprised of bug people and Shreks…

**Tannin:** Bugs, Mirama. Bugs!

**Galadriel:** Don’t forget Shreks. And fox people. And the clown said to me, “This is what you’re up against. I don’t think you realize what you’re facing.” It was terrifying. And their stated goal was to find this artifact, this coin, the three-sided coin, that would help them get to Slee.

**Mirama:** Now… this is certainly disturbing news. But I’m not sure why we think that the richest man we know wouldn’t be the one that hired this army.

**Galadriel:** You’re right; we don’t know that he’s not. But from our interactions with him, he did seem reluctant to get involved with any more intrigue.

**Mirama:** He’s a powerful man, and if the Amber Guard is to be believed, a mage of untold power.

**Galadriel:** *Is* the Amber Guard to be believed, though?!

**Harlan:** Glad someone said it.

**Galadriel:** We’ve known about corruption in their ranks for a long time now. A Guardsman blew himself up the night the safehouse was burned. And we know that Pouru was compromised by this group. We have reason to believe that Kandir and Vedit may be somehow in cahoots…

**Mirama:** Wait a minute. If you’re going to levy accusations against the other two members of the council, I hope you have something to back that up.

**Tannin:** We’re just following all our leads.

**Galadriel:** And we would just question the trust of the Amber Guard as an institution.

Mirama looks to Tannin, whom she trusts the most. 

**Mirama:** Are we going to do this? Levy accusations against my colleagues?

Tannin has a loose cannon look in his eyes, but it's contained... for now.

**Tannin:** We’re not to the point where we have any evidence, and we know we need something to go on. So let us help. How can we assist with the investigation?

Mirama sighs, as if truly doubting whether she should say the following.

**Mirama:** There is one thing. But it’d need to be off the books.

Tannin perks up.

**Mirama:** The one thing that bothers me about all this is that we haven’t had any interaction with Goldpeak. I’m not asking you to break him out or anything—certainly don’t do that—

She suddenly looks nervous. Galadriel winks at her.

**Galadriel:** Got it. Understood.

**Mirama:** Tannin, please don’t let her do that. But it’d be helpful if we had some of these records. We know that the Amber Guard has found some, but Goldpeak’s estate is locked down. If you could just get us anything you could find of value there… not monetary value, to be clear, but informational… if you go there and find evidence exonerating him, there you go. But even if not, it’d be helpful to have a general understanding of the breadth of his transactions so that we can pursue some of these other leads we have.

**Tannin:** Mirama, I’m impressed. You’re a woman of action. This is great. I’ll see what we can do.

# Black Unicorn

We go to the Black Unicorn to talk to its proprietor, a goblin named Slurpt Gearix. He says that the crackdown on magical goods is strong as ever, and one person aggrieved by this is Mr. Odo, the underground crime boss. Odo resents that Goldpeak is getting the credit for the city's major black market crimes. That's not to say that he envies Goldpeak's position right now, but he does want to be the most feared man in Aberith, and this situation has catapulted a new person into the role of Biggest Bad.

**Galadriel:** Have you seen any more Amber Guardsmen down here?

**Slurpt:** Patrolling, but not patronizing.

**Hanamir:** What about any news of a transmuter stone going missing?

Slurpt insinuates he wants a bribe for that kind of intel, and Galadriel shakes her head.

**Galadriel:** We’re a little bit short on funds these days, I'm afraid. Any sightings of cute little pigs?

**Slurpt:** Afraid not.

- This is somewhat worrisome, as Lolth had her sights set on him. 
- It's been quiet on the [Cazna](/characters/cazna/) front, too. 

We thank Slurpt and are on our way.

# [Deru](/characters/deru/)

We go to the Kord temple to talk to Deru [Nyanceth](/characters/nyanceth/), our two-time restorer of severed hands. We offer condolences on her father's recent death, and get her take on the current situation in Aberith.

She says that the last few years of her father’s life were difficult for her. So while she grieves him, there's also the sense of a burden being lifted, and the gratitude that he's no longer suffering. As for the council, she has little interest now that her father is no longer involved. She heard that maybe they won’t fill his position at all—the role of Minister of Sea was really created for him in his decline. (Tannin volunteers!) Mostly, the Minister of Trade has taken over his duties.

**Galadriel:** How’s attendance at the temple?

**Deru:** Hasn’t changed drastically since the last time we spoke. Not as strong as it was once, but it’s all right.

Her eyes glance at Harlan, and it seems like she wants to say something, but decides against it. Not angry, just… sad? Harlan stops and turns, gives her his symbol of Kord. Deru silently accepts it, and we see a little bit of moisture in her eyes. She nods at him. Harlan returns the nod, and we walk out.

- So Kandir is consolidating power—the Sea is his domain now, too.
- We assume he has Vedit under his control to some extent, and that's War.
- Is Mirama the only one who isn’t compromised by him at this point? Or... is she?
