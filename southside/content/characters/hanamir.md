# Case Files

Hanamir is conducting an [investigation on crimes affecting the property of the Drephis State University
Inter-Library-Loan system (DSU ILL)](/hanamir-case-files).


# Backstory

An orphaned half-orc, Hanamir was adopted in childhood by a small regional monastic college, part of the Drephis State University system.

An avid participant in the extracurricular Way of The Open Hand club (and not a natural academic), he was entrusted as a youth with increasing responsibilities managing inter-library loan deliveries.

Although he feels occasionally the chaotic pull of the Gruumsh, Hanamir finds affinity for the order of monastic tradition and the arcane rules of the library, leading to a generally Lawful Neutral alignment.

As our story begins, Hanamir found himself on a journey to a distant university to deliver a loan of books on bugbear cultural anthropology. The shipment entrusted to him was stolen - He assumed that the thieves mistook the tomes for spellbooks or similarly valuable material.

Resolute, Hanamir decided that he cannot return to his work at Drephis State without completing the delivery, or finding recompense for the crime.

# Affliations

Hanamir identifies strongly with the university, which he credits with providing him structure and order during his dangerous formative years. Owing to the mentorship of his teachers, he gained discipline, found a productive outlet for his considerable aggression, and acheived a measure of inner peace. He's strongly motivated to defend and support the institution, and the philosophy it represents.

The Harpers have a substantial presence among the faculty at DSU - while not a formal member, Hanamir is broadly sympathetic to their goals (although he disapproves of the subversion of lawful authority).

As is common with half-orcs, Hanamir has often felt the eye of Gruumsh upon him, laying implicit claim to his racial loyalty. He has never responded to these appeals, and has privately concluded that the orcish pantheon has brought nothing but suffering to the orcs, who would be capable of great things under better leadership.
