*(Broadcast test tone abruptly ends)*

We now return to the Tale of the Southside Chillers, already in progress. At this moment, our heroes stand before a door with twin inscriptions, one in Elvish, one in Draconic. They each translate, roughly, to the following:

*Lost soules wanderinge withoute cause*\
*Looking to bende immortall laws*\
*Heede theese words & taeke pause*\
*Seek not the blade upon worlds divyde*

*With theese words the laste of us atone*\
*Our treasure gods & cursèd throne*\
*For-ever seal’d in tombe of eternall stone*\
*Here our ultimatte pouere we seal insyde*

*Ancient spiritte, we make our finall asque*\
*Protecte the ruinne of our past*\
*& strongestte thronth the threshold passed*\
*Thronth that may your soule resyde.*

---

Galadriel peers at the Elvish inscription.

“Thronth?” she says, frowning.

“I’m pretty sure it’s supposed to be ‘through,’” says Hermione.

“All right, let’s think about this before we proceed,” says Harlan. “We’ve made it this far, against all odds. Can’t screw it up now.”

“I bet we can think through this logically,” says Hanamir. “Figure out a way to enter that works to our advantage.”

“What is there to think through?” says Tannin, twirling his trident. “It’ll use our strengths against us. Phil said so. Let’s go!” 

“Okay, who’s the strongest, then? You, right?” says Harlan. “Or Hanamir?”

“Hmm. We’re both really strong,” says Tannin. He flexes a bicep. “Hey! What if you tied us together before we go in? So we’re not as much of a threat?” 

“Are we to take it to mean *literal* strength…?” murmurs Hanamir.

“It says, ‘through that, may your soul reside’—is it going to possess one of you?” says Hermione.

“For real, at least tie *me* up,” Tannin says, enthused. “I’ll be disappointed not to fight the final boss… but what if I *am* the final boss?” 

“Are we assuming that ‘it’ is the ‘many-eyed god’ that all the temple guardians have been talking about?” says Harlan.

“Or—hear me out—tie *everyone* together so that all of us are the final boss, and we’re all as weak as possible,” Tannin continues.

The adventurers stack their ideas on top of one another until Galadriel holds up a hand.

“Wait,” she says. “You’re not the strongest, Tannin. And neither is Hanamir. It’s Buddy. He’s the strongest.”

Their eyes turn in unison to the pig at Galadriel’s feet. He sniffs at the air and licks his snout, utterly adorable.

“Okay,” says Hermione. “So we don’t bring him in.”

“And what about Magic? She’s powerful too, and unpredictable even when she’s not possessed,” says Harlan. “Maybe we don’t bring her in either.”

They glance at each other in silence for a moment, waiting for objections to be raised, but there are none.

“So, is that the plan, then? We leave Buddy and Magic outside?” says Harlan. “Should someone… stay behind and keep an eye on Magic?”

All of them look at Hermione.

“No!” she sputters. “Come on, guys! I’ve been saddled with Magic duty this entire time!”

“No, no, you’re right, Hermione,” says Galadriel. “And we need you in there with us if we’re going to get out of here alive. Let’s find a place we can leave Magic that’s safe.”

“Maybe the octopus closet?” says Hanamir.

“And we could ask Phil to keep an eye on that door!” says Tannin.

“What can he do?” says Harlan. “He’s stuck in the mirror.”

“Buddy can watch her,” says Hermione. “She’s already scared of him.”

She nods at Magic, who is hunched against the wall behind her, wide-eyed, shivering, and pale. 

“Yeah, this little dude can handle her,” says Tannin. “Worst-case scenario, he just blasts her with dragon breath, right?”

Galadriel kneels down to Buddy’s eye level.

*Are you going to be all right if we leave you alone with Magic again?*

Buddy oinks noncommittally.

I DON’T LOOK FORWARD TO IT. BUT I THINK YOU’RE RIGHT THAT I’D GET POSSESSED IF I WENT IN WITH YOU. IT’S SAFER FOR ALL OF US IF I STAY OUTSIDE.

“He says okay,” says Galadriel.

They lead Magic back through the mirror room to the octopus closet and transfer one of her shackles to the octopus statue itself.

“Don’t leave me!” she whimpers, articulating a complete thought for the first time since the incident in the oni room. “Please!”

“I’m sorry, Magic,” says Harlan. He tugs at the shackles. “We have to. We can’t take the risk that the spirit will possess you.”

“No! Don’t—don’t—chain me up like an animal!”

Harlan sighs with a mixture of guilt and resolve.

“What choice do we have?” he asks.

“You could let me fight for once!” rasps Magic. “Let me help!”

“I’m sorry. I really am. But this foe we’re about to face might be able to possess you and use your considerable powers against us. And we just can’t take that gamble.”

Magic goes silent, sulking furiously.

“We will come back for you,” says Harlan. “I promise. We are not leaving you here forever.”

He tries to make eye contact with her, but she stares at the ground.

“You’ll regret this,” says Magic.

“Why’s that?”

She turns away and doesn’t respond.

“Okay. See you soon, Magic.”

As the adventurers leave the octopus closet, Harlan looks back one more time at the tiefling chained to the statue, her shoulders shaking with noiseless sobs. His throat tightens. He turns away.

“It’s for the best,” whispers Hermione.

They return to the doors engraved with a final warning, one they never had any intention of heeding. Hanamir pushes against the stone lightly. It’s not locked.

“I expect that there will be a set of stairs behind these doors that lead us up to the highest level of the pyramid,” he says. “And in there, we’ll face the guardian of the quiznos.”

They look at one another, waiting for someone to make the next move. There is the sense in the stale air that they ought to be saying their goodbyes, but no one wants to be the first to turn that idea into sound. 

In the silence, Galadriel kneels down and kisses Buddy’s head. 

*Whatever happens in there, I want you to know I love you,* she thinks. *So much.* She blinks back tears. *And if I don’t come back, I want you to change back to your true form and fly away, okay?*

HEY, NONE OF THAT.

A tear escapes down her cheek. She brushes it away. Buddy rests his snout against her knee and waits for her to look him in the eye.

I’LL BE OUT HERE LISTENING IF YOU NEED ME.

Galadriel nods, sniffling, and stands up. She sees Tannin looking pleased at Harlan’s begrudging agreement to tie his hands behind his back.

Without further chatter, they assume initiative order.

“Ready, team?” says Hanamir. 

He pushes the door open.

---

The lower levels of the temple bear the scuff marks of centuries of boots, but the broad staircase to the top level is pristine. Its steps of polished stone are slippery with dust. The adventurers tiptoe like mice up to the single wide room that comprises the temple’s apex. There they stand, half waiting to be vaporized on the spot, half memorizing their surroundings in nervous awe.

From the staircase, the footpath branches across the floor, dividing the room into visually distinct zones: a sandy dune, a marsh spotted with ribbonweed and lily pads, a frozen tundra, a gorge of indeterminate depth, and a single grassy hillock beneath a circular portal in the ceiling.

After a minute of stillness, a voice echoes softly from nowhere in particular.

“Have you come to take the quiznos?” 

The air is strung tight with tension in the silence that follows. Galadriel steps forward.

“Yeah,” she announces.

Hermione grabs her elbow and pulls her back. 

“No! We’re not here to take anything!” she says, waving a hand too fervently to pass for a gesture of dismissal. “We’re, uh, we’re lost!”

The energy in the air curdles. 

“Nah, we’re here to take the quiznos though,” says Galadriel. To Hermione, she adds, “I’ve lied to gods before, and I’d rather not do it again.”

The room seems to vibrate as if laughing softly. The voice returns, but as a whisper. They each feel its gentle breath against their ears.

“They call me the Many-Eyed God,” it says. “Do you want to know why?”

Over top of one another, Harlan and Tannin say “No, thank you,” and “Kinda, yeah,” respectively.

“Let me show you,” whispers the voice.

They watch as Galadriel turns rigid and levitates a few inches off the ground. Her neck bends unnaturally as she peers back at the others, and they see that her eyes are not her own.

“Because your eyes are my eyes,” the terrible voice whispers from Galadriel’s mouth.

“My sincere apologies! As I said before, we are hopelessly lost!” Hermione tries again. “Would you be so kind as to direct us toward the way out?”

Galadriel’s floating body shudders with laughter.

“So fragile, this vessel,” she says, looking down at herself, then back at the group, scanning their faces. “I wonder if I might have more fun with this one?”

Her eyes lose focus and roll back into her head and her body collapses to the ground. Hermione jumps back as Hanamir is the next to rise into the air like an oversized marionette.

“Better!” the voice sneers, twisting Hanamir’s face in a malevolent grin. “But still a meager offering. No, no, this won’t do.” Hanamir’s irises move erratically back and forth as if dreaming with his eyes open. The voice diminishes to a hiss. “None of you will do.”

Hanamir falls in a heap next to Galadriel, who is scrambling to her feet. She helps him up. A rumbling noise comes from underground, and with a force that sends cattails and swamp water splattering to the walls, a massive snake emerges from the marsh. It is partly decomposed, with patches of scales missing to reveal the skeleton inside. 

“Untie me! Untie me! Untie me!” Tannin whispers.

“All right, all right, hold on,” says Harlan. He fumbles with his dagger.

The voice returns, resounding against every surface of the room, from the giant snake’s rotting mouth.

“Since you didn’t bring me anything to play with,” it says, “I’ll have to make my own fun.”

“Now! Come on, Harlan!” says Tannin. He bounces from one foot to another like a child waiting in line for the bathroom.

“On it, on it, on it,” says Harlan. He saws at the ropes around Tannin’s wrists.

Galadriel dusts herself off and readies an arrow.

“I am *so* glad we didn’t bring Buddy in here,” she says, wide-eyed.

“Yes! And Magic too!” says Harlan, finally slicing through Tannin’s bonds. “Good job, everyone.”

“At Drephis State, we’d have earned an A in History for our interpretation of a primary source back there,” notes Hanamir. “Or perhaps in Comparative Poetry.”

Meanwhile, Hermione is flipping through her notebook.

“Okay, I’ve never seen a snake of this size before,” she says, stopping at a page of notes interspersed with detailed anatomical drawings of serpents. “But in general, we’ll want to aim for the head, especially if it’s venomous, and we shouldn’t stop until it’s [completely decapitated](http://www.247wildlife.com/snakekill.html).”

Tannin, not absorbing this advice at all, has already flown into a rage. He launches himself forward in an Olympic-style long jump and stabs the snake in its belly.

“Oh, wow, ew,” says Harlan. Tannin’s trident catches on some decaying snake innards and rips them out like a forkful of overcooked ramen noodles.

Simultaneously, Hanamir folds himself into an elegant monkish pose for a hot second and then beans the snake right in the face with one of his darts. It’s not a particularly damaging hit on its own, but the meditative pose has a magical effect on the snake. Its eyes turn into cartoon spirals, and it sways in place, unable to react to the dual attacks on its face and guts.

“What did you do to it?” asks Hermione, stuffing her notebook back in her bag.

“That was a Stunning Strike,” says Hanamir proudly. “It can’t speak or move. Should be much easier to hit.”

“Let’s give it a try!” she says. Hermione readies a set of Magic Missiles to launch at the snake, but she catches a glimpse at the pit and sees two undead soldiers climbing out onto the path. “Or not!” She shoots the projectiles at them instead, and they fall back into the abyss.

“No worries, let me,” says Galadriel. She casts Cloud of Daggers at the snake, and her usual flurry of tiny blades slices through several more scales on the snake’s hide. 

Tannin, meanwhile, has loosened the snake’s noodly intestines up again with another stab of the trident. The foul pile of offal is almost taller than he is.

“Guys!” shouts Harlan, raising his hammer for a swing. “Is it just me, or is this going *too* well?!”

At that moment, the snake breaks free from its stunned state. Its eyes narrow into furious slits of bright yellow in its dull green face. Tannin and Harlan, whose melee weapons have forced them to come the closest, do not have time to get out of the way before a spinning column of fire descends upon them from an unseen source.

The flames expand, wrapping wider and wider circles around the two of them. The entire room’s temperature rises. After a long two seconds, Tannin somersaults free, looking like a well-done steak. It takes another three seconds for the divine fire to disappear, and by that time, all that’s left of Harlan is a lump of coal holding a hammer. Remarkably, he is not deceased.

“Never mind!” says Harlan’s voice from the smoky chipotle-flavored ashes of his human form. “The thing about it going too well! I take it back.”

“Aha,” says Hanamir. “That must be the aforementioned ‘fiery death’ referenced by more than one temple inscription.”

“I’m going to try and get a better vantage point from that hill,” says Hermione. She darts down the path toward the hill, and when she gets there, the ground tries to shake her off. Its surface rolls like a pot of boiling water, but she clings on and makes it to the top.

“I think the quiznos must be up there!” she yells, looking up at the hole in the ceiling. “It looks like a room full of treasure!”

“I’ll try and get in,” says Galadriel, climbing up a wall and creeping toward the hole in the ceiling.

Hermione refocuses her attention on the snake. She conjures a sphere of flames in her hand and lobs it at the putrid creature.

“Since you like fire so much!” she says with a grin. More and more of the snake’s skeleton reveals itself as the Fireball blasts a hole in what Hermione knows to be its trachea but what the other adventurers would call its “snake chest,” or “snest.”

From the gem-lined opening in the ceiling, Galadriel fires off an arrow at the snake.

“Right in the snest!” she crows, then pauses, frowning. “Hey, do you think this is the right approach? I mean, is the Many-Eyed God just going to move to a different host once we destroy this one?”

“What else are we supposed to do?” shouts charcoal briquette Harlan, landing a hit with his hammer on the snake’s back.

“We could try and trap it!” says Tannin.

The snake roars at Tannin, and with a zap from its eyes, the dwarf disappears from view.

“It didn’t like that idea,” Hermione observes. She casts Fireball again at the snake. Another hole is burned into its abdomen, revealing several more ribs. Tannin reappears in the marsh, unharmed. It’s honestly perfect timing.

“I was in a pocket dimension, I think!” he announces. “What’d I miss?”

Hanamir charges into the marsh and plunges his sword into the gaping wound in the snake’s snest. It groans, retreating under the water and reappearing in the desert area, covered in sand like a breaded chicken cutlet. As it emerges from the dune, it catches sight of Galadriel peeking into the treasure room in the ceiling. Another pillar of flame erupts from thin air and swallows the two adventurers nearest the hill—Galadriel and Hermione.

“It’s angry,” says Harlan. “We’re close!”

He casts Sacred Flame at the snake, and the holy fire exposes its mottled heart. Without wasting a second, Tannin hurls a javelin that pierces the bloated muscle and pins the snake against the wall. From the ceiling, a seared and crispy Galadriel casts Cloud of Daggers, and the knives sever the remaining connections between the snake’s head and body. Its head rolls to the ground, landing upside down in a drift of sand.

The adventurers, battered but victorious, cheer.

“Hold on,” says Galadriel. “I’m still not sure we’re done here.”

From the snake’s detached head, a dark shape emerges. It takes the form of an Olmen king wearing a crown of jewels and feathers. His face is blurred, as if obscured by a shadow that never moves.

“You have passed the final trial,” says the king. “You are free to proceed and take the treasure.”

“Uhhh,” says Tannin. “Really?”

“How does it work?” says Hermione. “Explain how the quiznos works, please!”

The spirit king gestures toward the hole in the ceiling, saying nothing.

“You gonna roast us again if I climb in there?” says Galadriel.

“No,” he says. “You have proven yourselves worthy.”

“I can’t tell if you’re bullshitting me or not,” she says. “But we’ve come too far for me to chicken out now.”

She climbs up.
