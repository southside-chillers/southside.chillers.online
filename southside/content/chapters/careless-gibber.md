Having made herself invisible, Galadriel spider-climbs up the wall of Noke’s living room and perches on the ceiling. [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) hides behind a set of barrels. Only [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) is out in the open, fixing his gaze on the Bed Dragon with equal measures of surprise and consternation. Noke has come down the stairs from his bedroom and now sits on the dragon’s back. 

"I’ll give you one more chance to turn over the sheep," says Noke. 

"We didn’t want this to end in violence, but I guess that’s how it’s going to have to be," sighs Harlan, readying his maul.

"Hand it over, or I’ll end you all!" says Noke.

"In your dreams!" says Galadriel. 

The Bed Dragon grunts, and its voice sounds like cracking wood. Then it roars with something called Splinter Breath, which is as bad as it sounds, and blasts everything in a fifteen-foot cone in front of it with splinters. Galadriel, though invisible, is pricked with millions of tiny pieces of wood, and feels that she has immediately lost 84% of her overall health. 

"Ow," she says. She shoots an arrow at the dragon and hits, but it’s not much revenge, as it is excruciatingly painful to move, what with all the splinters. "Can I have some bread?"

"If you’re sure," says Harlan. He tosses the satchel containing the Bread of Eternal Hunger toward her voice and she catches it. 

"Yeah, I’m already screwed anyway, what with Lolth and all," she says, and eats a piece of bread. She only gains back 13% of her health, though, if she had to quantify it. "Damn, that was not even worth my eternal soul."

Harlan casts Command on Noke. "Come down off of the dragon," he says, his voice magically amplified. Noke has no choice but to obey. As he does, Hanamir leaps out from his hiding place behind the barrels and punches him in the face. The Bed Dragon takes the opportunity to snap its splintery teeth at Harlan, taking a substantial chunk out of Harlan’s thigh.

"Can I have my bread back now?" Harlan quips, ripping a spare bit of bedsheet wing into a tourniquet. 

"Not unless I do my Song of Voiding and vomit it into your mouth like a baby bird," says Galadriel. "I wonder if that would work!"

"No thank you," says Harlan. He opts to cast Cure Wounds on himself instead, but it takes the last of his magical ability.

"Hanamir, we’re counting on you, bud," says Galadriel. "This dragon is getting the best of us."

"Change your focus from the dragon to the wizard, I think," says Hanamir, barely breaking a sweat as he pummels Noke again.

"Wise," says Galadriel, and she releases an arrow that hits Noke in the arm—not very damaging, but breaking his concentration. The Bed Dragon collapses into a pile of wood and sheets. 

Noke manages to break away from Hanamir and, not seeing a lot of options, pulls out the wand of true polymorph. It’s still sparking and fizzing. He turns it toward himself. The adventurers watch in slow-motion horror as the old man begins to melt into a pile of flesh, eyes, and teeth, babbling and screaming incoherently. He has turned himself, they realize, into a Gibbering Mouther, and it cannot have been on purpose. The wand falls to the floor, smoking.

One of the creature’s mouths spits some unfathomably disgusting fluid at Hanamir, blinding him instantly. One of its other mouths then manages to bite him, bringing Hanamir down to a similar level of injury as Galadriel and Harlan. This is the closest the three of them have been to being completely defeated, and boy howdy, what a way to go it would be.

"Move backward, Hanamir," Galadriel guides him from the ceiling. "It looks like when you get too close, the ground gets...squishy...and gross…" 

"Any idea how to fight this thing?" Harlan yells at Shinebright, who has been cowering in the doorway the entire battle. 

"It’s very slow!" baas Shinebright. "Very slow, very dumb, very easy to hit. Just don’t get close to it." He stares at the Gibbering Mouther in what looks like disappointment, but it’s hard to tell on a sheep’s face. "Oh, young Noke. What have you done?"

Hanamir makes a successful attack at the Mouther with his sword, and uses the momentum to push himself backward and out of the monster’s gooey influence. "Bad energy if you get too close to that thing," he concludes, shuddering. "Those voices...not good."

The critically wounded adventurers each take turns launching their ranged weapons at the Gibbering Mouther. No matter how poor their aim, they can’t seem to miss it. After one last arrow from Galadriel, the creature takes multiple final breaths from its many mouths and dies, at least freed from its evident torment.

"That was a really close one," she says.

"Even closer than when we fought the dragon in the Lolth tower," says Harlan.

"Much too close," says Hanamir.

Shinebright is leaping in the doorway, baaing his appreciation. 

"You did it! I can’t believe it! You defeated him!" he bleats. He is peering at the wand, which sits on the floor next to the hideous pile of flesh. "Now pick it up and turn me back!"

Harlan translates.

"Wait," says Galadriel, "you’re not worried about turning into one of...those?"

"Might be a little unsafe," says Hanamir. 

"Look, this wand originally only had three charges of true polymorph in it, but I’ve been able to make it last for years," Shinebright explains. The wand is still emitting a heck of a lot of black smoke. "I don’t want to be a sheep anymore!"

"Okay, but even if we succeed in turning you back, you agree that this wand should be, um, retired, right?" asks Harlan. "Like...if it can accidentally turn things into that…"

"Oh, there’s always that chance," scoffs Shinebright. "I know how to use it. Please just turn me!"

"We promise to try," says Harlan. "But we’ll need to compromise on the wand—and set your expectation for the fact that it just can’t be used anymore. It’s too dangerous."

"If you want to see if it works, try it out on your pig friend here," says Shinebright, waving a hoof at Buddy. "Turn him back to what he really is, too."

"You know, that’s an idea," Harlan says, giving Galadriel a look.

"Harlan, I swear on my life, if you turn Buddy into a Gibbering Mouther I will never—" Galadriel starts, but Harlan interrupts.

"What are the odds of it malfunctioning? Like how often have you seen things turn into Mouthers?" Harlan considers.

"Oh, it’s pretty unlikely," baas Shinebright.

"It just happened," says Galadriel. "We just saw that happen."

"Yeah, so, lightning doesn’t strike the same place twice!" says Shinebright. Galadriel shakes her head.

"Can we at least take a long rest before we try anything?" she asks. "I’m sure we’ll have a better shot at success if we’re back at our full capacity. Thinking clearly. Feeling powerful."

"I like that idea," says Hanamir, who has wandered into the library area and has begun checking out the titles. "More romance novels in here than you’d expect. You a romance novel guy, Shinebright?" He picks out one that looks interesting.

"Yes," agrees Harlan. "Let’s just take the rest of the day easy, and tomorrow we’ll turn you back to your true self."

Shinebright is not happy about this, but retreats to the garden to eat flowers and sulk. It’s still fairly early in the afternoon, but the adventurers have been through the wringer and are eager to rest. Galadriel finds a pair of tweezers and begins removing the Bed Dragon splinters from her face. Hanamir spends the evening breezing through two novels: The Time Traveler’s Tiefling and The Opposite of Rage is Love: A Barbarian Romance. Harlan finds some earplugs and tries to ignore the conversations of every bird that has found a nesting spot in the tower’s many crevices (with limited success).

All in all, they spend a pleasant night in the tower, and emerge the next morning feeling good as new. Galadriel even manages to find the time to bedazzle Buddy’s collar and polish his hooves. 

"All right," says Shinebright, with Harlan translating for him. "Now, one of you, please, please, please, turn me back into an elf." 

"I’ll try," says Galadriel. "But I just...I’m worried for you. You’re not worried?!"

The sheep baas at her insistently.

"Okay," she says. "If you’re super sure…"

She picks up the wand and takes a closer look. It is in truly terrible shape, with lots of foreign objects apparently fused into it and glued to its surface. It shudders with unstable magic in her hand. 

She points it at Shinebright and, squinting and turning away, gives it a wave. For a hopeful moment, they see the sheep turn into a distinguished-looking elf of indeterminate age—but then the elf starts to bubble and melt, and in another moment, Shinebright too has become a Gibbering Mouther, shrieking and drooling. He seems to absorb the parts of the dead Mouther that was sitting right next to him.

"Well," sighs Galadriel, "I tried."

"Okay, yeah, I’m so done with this," says Harlan. "Let’s leave."

They turn toward the door. What’s left of Shinebright gurgles something that sounds like "hey waaaait…" and it seems to give Galadriel an idea.

"Hey," she says, pulling out her vial of Magic’s plane-shifting potion, "what if we plane-shifted this guy?"

"You’d have to throw it," says Hanamir. "Trust me, you do not want to get close to that thing."

Harlan just shrugs. 

"Yeah, do it," he says with a dismissive wave of his hands. "I’m over it."

Galadriel lobs the vial of potion across the room at the mass of skin, hair, mouths, and eyeballs. It’s not even a good throw, but the glass breaks. In an instant, the Gibbering Mouther that was once a noble elf wizard vanishes from existence.

"Wow," she says. "I wonder where it went."

"Wherever Tannin went, probably," muses Hanamir.

With all the Mouthers gone, the room is quiet. 

"You know, this place is nice," says Harlan. "For all his faults, Shinebright had great taste in interior decor." He walks a wide circle around the room and runs a hand across the surface of a shiny oak table. "I didn’t really notice before."

"It’s true," says Galadriel. She approaches the pile of sheets and wood that was once a bed (and then a transmuted dragon), and casts Mend Object on it. The shattered bedposts spring back together to form a handsome frame, while the ripped textile elements sew themselves up. The result is a supremely cozy-looking queen-size bed, neatly made up and topped with fat pillows. "I’d sleep in that."

"And these books!" says Hanamir, wandering back to the shelves, sounding giddy. "I’ve never read anything like them. There were a few more titles I wanted to check out...but I don’t know if anything can stack up to The Time Traveler’s Tiefling!"

"Want to hang out here, then?" says Harlan. "Just for one more night? We deserve a break."

The adventurers stay another night in the wizard’s tower. Hanamir reads Wuthering Underdark and cries a little at the end. Harlan plants an herb garden. Galadriel builds Buddy a mini pig palace. 

"Okay, just one more night," says Galadriel, tucking Buddy into his little bed. 

The next day, they discover a secret compartment in Shinebright’s bedroom wall. Inside is a spellbook written in a language none of them is familiar with—the first item that actually indicates Shinebright had an academic interest in magic beyond the use of his polymorph wand. There’s also 120 gold pieces and a few spell scrolls, which they divide among themselves. 

Another day turns into a few more days, and soon the adventurers forget exactly how long they’ve spent at Shinebright’s tower. Harlan’s garden is thriving (basil, chives, mint, spring peas, heirloom tomatoes) and Galadriel spends most of her days writing songs and taking naps with Buddy in front of the Net of Flyx (Shinebright’s arcane portal into other universes). Hanamir reads every item in Shinebright’s vast romance novel collection (he says it’s hard to rank them, but if he had to pick a favorite, it would be Eventide). 

At one point, Harlan empties his metric ton of copper coins into an antechamber and dives right in. It’s the first time he’s felt like maybe he didn’t get a raw deal when he opened that treasure chest in the Lolth tower. It changes his perspective on life, really—and afterward, he approaches Galadriel and Hanamir, who are finishing up an intense game of Ye Olde Fantasy Wordmatch in the kitchen.

"Do you guys think we should head back to town soon?" Harlan asks. He pours himself a cup of coffee and looks around for a snack. 

"Sure," says Galadriel, attempting a triple word score with "Blibdoolpoolp."

"That’s a proper noun," says Hanamir. "Doesn’t count."

"But it’s so good," she cries.

"Too bad," says Hanamir. He checks his points. "Looks like I win."

"Ugh, fine," says Galadriel. "Okay, one more round, and then we’ll head back to town."

Galadriel learns the hard way that playing Wordmatch with a librarian is a losing game. She packs her things up in a bit of a foul mood, but once they’re back on the road, she’s back to her usual self. 

"That was fun, you guys," she says. "I feel like we bonded a lot over there."

"Yeah, and we really turned that place into a home," says Harlan. "I wonder if we could try renting it out? Having a little bit of extra gold wouldn’t hurt us on our adventures. And it’s not like Shinebright’s coming back for it."

"We’d need to find a property manager," says Hanamir. "Someone to handle the tenants when we’re traveling. But I agree."

As they approach the outskirts of Eillin, they notice that guards are posted at each entrance to the town. 

"A half-orc, half-elf, and human traveling together?" says a guard. "What is your business in Eillin?"

"You haven’t heard of us?" Galadriel says, miffed. "We’re local heroes."

"The mayor can attest to this," says Hanamir. "As can King Slee of Aberith." He pauses and then shouts confidently, "Send for the king!"

"Uh, that won’t be necessary," says the guard. "But fine, if Frunk can vouch for you, come in."

The vibe in town is tense. Frunk meets them at the tavern, looking harried.

"Where have you three been?" he snaps at them. "You left with that sheep and didn’t say anything for weeks. We’ve been on lockdown. Can’t find Bryn’s killer."

"We’re sorry," says Harlan. "We lost track of time. The sheep turned out to be Bryn’s friend, a wizard."

"Oh, Shinebright?" says Frunk. "How’s he doing?"

"Bad," says Galadriel. "We accidentally—"

"Uhhh, due to a harrowing series of events, started by his renegade apprentice, he was unfortunately turned into a horrific monster and plane-shifted out of reality," says Harlan.

"It’s been a chaotic time," says Hanamir.

"Yes, chaotic," agrees Harlan. "So chaotic that it’s hard to say who’s responsible for what. But he’s gone."

"Hmm," says Frunk, not following. "So Shinebright’s not living at that tower on route 2 anymore?"

"No, and we wanted to ask you about that," says Harlan. "Do you know where we might find someone experienced at managing real estate? We did a bit of work refurbishing the place and are thinking of renting it out."

"We could put a flyer up in the tavern, I suppose," says Frunk. "Or you could just ask H’Jun. He needs something else to do besides drink. He could be your guy." He gestures to the end of the bar, where H’Jun is loudly telling his dragon encounter story to Fleck.

"We’ll consider it!" says Harlan brightly. "Anyway, have you found out any more details about the murder?"

"Not much. But we do know this: Shinebright was considered a person of interest in the case due to his relationship to Bryn. Now, you say he was turned into a sheep at this time, so it seems unlikely to me that he could stab a man. A humanoid figure was seen leaving the premises the night of the murder, so it could really have been anyone. Maybe one of the orcs, as they passed through the area. But no one knows where they went, so their motive is inscrutable." Frunk scratches his head. "It’s been a hell of a time in Eillin. We really could use your help investigating this. The guards won’t admit that, but I will."

"Did Bryn make anyone angry?" asks Galadriel.

"Or was he perhaps studying something dangerous?" asks Hanamir.

"That’s the thing, we don’t know," says Frunk. "There was one book of his that did get stolen; we know that based on his organizing system, but we’re not sure which one. His interests were so varied, I guess it’s possible he worked on some controversial things..."

"Who were his known associates? I know he was a shy person, but surely he knew some people in town," says Harlan.

"Well," says Frunk, lowering his voice. "You know about...the order I mentioned? The order that is tasked with protecting the town? Bryn was a member." He pauses. "But I don’t know who would be aware that he’s one of us. We keep that information under wraps."

"If someone does know who’s in the order, and is trying to take people out...who do you speculate would be the next target?" says Hanamir. 

Frunk is silent, chewing on his lip.

"I don’t think I can tell you the members of the order," he says. 

"We don’t wish to breach your privacy, but we do wish to protect the town," says Harlan. "We promise to be careful custodians of any sensitive information you provide us with."

Frunk nods, then sighs.

"You’ve proven yourselves trustworthy in the matter of the Moon Festival," he says. "King Slee and I did want to hire you to help out the order when necessary...telling you things on a need-to-know basis...but maybe it’s time we tell you everything."

The adventurers are silent, their drinks untouched, waiting for him to continue.

"So. We’re known as the Order of the Been," says Frunk. "King Slee and I are the only two surviving first order members. Uncle was the founder." He sips his ale. "Bryn was a second order member, along with the Savage, and Feld—you may have met him at the Moon Festival. H’Jun’s cousin."

"We actually met him in the Lolth priestesses’ tower," says Galadriel. "He was imprisoned there. But go on."

"H’Jun is a member too, but only fourth-order. Same with our bartender here, Fleck."

"So who do you think would be next in line as a target, if Bryn was the first?" asks Harlan.

"Well, Bryn was the most isolated of all of us. So it makes sense they went after him first," says Frunk. "I think I’d worry about H’Jun next. His problem with drinking makes him, um…" 

"Easy to poison," Galadriel finishes as he trails off. 

"Fleck is blind, so he’s also vulnerable. But I can’t imagine anyone knowing he’s a member," says Frunk. "It’s safe to say people know that myself and the King are in some form of allegiance, and maybe they know enough to connect us to the Savage. But Fleck is not an obvious associate of ours."

"Perhaps the book that was stolen contained information about the identities of the people in the order," suggests Galadriel.

"Nothing about the order has ever been put to paper," says Frunk. "We’re very serious about that."

"How long is the king planning to keep his guards here?" asks Hanamir.

"As long as it takes," sighs Frunk. "Until we can be confident we’re safe. This is the first real murder we’ve had, you know—lots of orc raids in the past, but no crimes of passion, really. The king pledged his troops as long as the threat persists."

"So, would you give us your blessing to speak to the other members of the order about this?" says Harlan.

"It’s not technically allowed," says Frunk. "But I believe in this case it is necessary. I will give you this ring, and if you show it to a member of the Been, he will be permitted to speak to you on matters pertaining to the order."

He hands Harlan a simple gold ring inscribed with a "B."

"This was Bryn’s ring," says Frunk. "And it’s interesting to me that whoever killed him did not take this ring. It was still on his finger when we found his body. It may mean that his murderer did not know about the Been after all."

"We saw a ring like this in the market once," says Galadriel. "We told the Savage about it the first time we met him, since we saw that he was wearing the same thing. And when we went to see if it was still there, it was gone. We think it was Uncle’s, and that the Savage bought it."

"Interesting," says Frunk. "I was unaware of this. If he has two rings, he hasn’t made that known to us."

The group is silent, taking sips from their drinks and pondering what the Savage’s behavior might indicate. 

"Well, I think our next step should be going back to the crime scene," says Hanamir. "We should see if we can deduce what book from Bryn’s collection was stolen. It might be a clue to the murderer’s identity."

"Yes," says Harlan. "And we should also ask around about starting our property empire."

They leave a generous tip for Fleck, who is still being forced to listen to H’Jun’s intoxicated ramblings, and head out into the town square. The sun is settling over Eillin, and it would be a gorgeous evening if not for the nervous energy pervading the place.

"What a strange adventure that was," says Hanamir. "With the sheep, I mean."

"Yeah," says Galadriel. "Do you think we did it right?"

"You mean like, did we do the right thing?" asks Harlan.

"Yeah, like, was there any other way that could have gone?" she wonders. "We tried to help, and we did, but it turned into a whole mess with the Gibbering Mouthers...and then we sort of stole his house…"

"We tried," says Harlan. "And we learned some interesting things. Such as the fact that our little friend here is not really a pig." He tilts his head toward Buddy, who is adorably peeking out of the top of Galadriel’s backpack.

Galadriel reaches back and gives Buddy a gentle noogie on his fuzzy little head. 

"Yeah! They keep trying it, my sweet baby boy!" she giggles. "They keep trying to turn me against you, but they can’t. I don’t care what you are. You and me, friends forever!"

Harlan groans. Hanamir just goes "hmm" in a disapproving manner. Buddy licks the back of Galadriel’s neck and oinks.

Galadriel suddenly acknowledges the camera again, bringing the story back to this weird meta place where it’s a TV special and she’s the host. She winks.

Roll credits.

# Pantheon of the Gods

by Malon Magris 

We have spent many years studying the gods, their comings and goings and their power struggles in an attempt to better understand the forces that shape our world.

While there are countless entities wielding godlike power, is widely believed that there are 13 supreme entities.

As you know, the gods are often categorized into 8 domains.

There are two domains that are the sole domain of good.  The domains of Life and Light, overseen by **Pelor** and **Photos** respectively.

* **Pelor** is the god of the Sun, responsible for the creation of good in this world.
* **Pholtus** is a close ally of **Pelor**’s and associated with Law and Light.

Just as **Pelor** and **Photos** lay claim to the domains most associated with good in the world, the evil-aligned Death and Trickery domains are the dominion of **Nerull** and **Tharizdun**.

* **Nerull** is the god of Death, Darkness, Murder, and the Underworld
* **Tharizdun** is the creator of the Abyss, god of eternal darkness.

Just as war can be just and unjust, fought for good or evil purpose, there are two sides of the War domain.

* **Erythnul** represents destruction, envy, and slaughter
* **Trithereon** represents liberty and retribution

Likewise, the Tempest domain has a light and dark component.  Both **Kord** and **Gruumsh** lay claim to storms, and are closely aligned with their war-god counterparts.

Unique among the domains of gods is the Knowledge domain in being represented by three gods.

* **Boccob**, the god of magic whose gift has allowed magic to flourish.
* **Istus**, is the goddess of fate and destiny, her knowledge is neutral, she is only concerned with the fate of the cosmos, not petty squabbles between good and evil.
* *-page missing-*

And finally the Nature domain. **Obad-Hai** is the god of Nature and **Beory** is thought of by her druidic followers as the avatar of the planet itself.  Their unwillingness to take a side has earned them the ire of their fellow gods.

## Ranking the Gods

It seems mortals are obsessed with understanding the relative power of the gods.  In a sense this is a fruitless endeavor, the true extent of their powers are unknown.  A mortal seeking to determine the difference between **Pelor** and **Pholtus**' might would be akin to asking whether or a a longsword or a great axe is more likely to slay a rat.  That said, our publisher demands we provide this information as it moves parchment.

### Power Rankings

* It is fair to say that **Pelor**, **Tharizdun**, and **Istus** have no known peers in their respective areas of interest.
* Little is known of **Beory**'s power but if what her followers believe is true, she would surely be more powerful than most other deities.
* As close allies of **Pelor** and **Tharizdun** and owners of entire domains in their own right, **Nerull** and **Photus** are formidable beings that control forces as powerful as death and light itself.
* **Erythnul**, **Trithereon**, **Kord**, and **Gruumsh** have never solidified control over their domains and as such are seen as slightly less formidable than their peers.  That said, to underestimate them would be a mistake as they are possibly the most ambitious of the gods.
* Little is known of the power of **Obad-Hai**, **Boccob**, and *-torn-*

And of course, each of the gods has their demigod accomplices and there are the gods that create and protect their own kind.

## Other Gods of Note

* **Surtur** - god of Fire Giants
* **Thrym** - god of Frost Giants
* **Laoggzed** - god of Troglodytes
* **Hruggek** - god of Bugbears
* **Sekolah** - god of Sahuagin
* **Corellon** - creator of the Elves
* **Lolth** - goddess of the Drow
* **Shargaas** - Orc Diety of Thieves and Night
* **Tiamat** - God of Trickery and Queen of the Chromatic Dragons
* **Blibdoolpoolp** - kuo-toa goddess of death
* **Moradin** -  dwarf god of creation 
* **Yondalla** -  halfling goddess of fertility and protection 
* **Sehanine** -  elf goddess of the moon 
* **Maglubiyet** -  goblinoid god of war 
* **Grolantor** - hill giant god of war 
* **Bahamut** -  deity of metallic dragons
