# Setting out

We are given a map and directions to a cave, said to be the site of a manticore den. It’s back in the direction of Eillin, south of Aberith.

We discuss whether or not stealing manticore eggs is technically poaching, and whether [Odo](/characters/odo/) is operating a manticore fighting ring, or what. We decide that's none of our business.

# [Nim](/characters/nim/) and [Nizana](/characters/nizana/)

On the road, we run into two people we recognize. They are Nim and Nizana, a drow father and son who speak heavily Undercommon-accented Common. Last time we ran into them, they told us about the Messenger. They’re again heading to Aberith. They recognize us.

**Nim:** G’day mates. Didn’t think we’d see you all again. 

**[Tannin](/characters/tannin/):** Crikey! Good to see you both. You’ve never met this bloke, have you?

He gestures toward [Chunk](/characters/chunk/), whom they indeed have not met. They take a step back.

**Nim:** Can’t say we have. Wow, what are you?

**Chunk:** Well, I’m a firbolg.

**Nim:** Nice to meet you, then.

**Tannin:** Anyway, we’ve been fighting some clowns lately. Seen any clowns, mates?

**Nim:** Clowns?

**[Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/):** Yes, with face paint on, and robes.

**Nim:** We’ve just been out here spreading the word, no clowns.

**[Harlan](/characters/harlan/):** The word of the Messenger?

**Nim:** Yes, that’s roight.

**Harlan:** And what is the good word?

**Nim:** Well, it’s just that the gods, they’ve tried to trick us. [The Messenger](/characters/the-messenger/) is aware of the truth of their deceit. We’re just out here trying to get people to wake up to that.

**Tannin:** Have you spread the word in that cave? That’s where we’re heading now. Maybe there’s a settlement or something.

**Nim:** No, but we'd be glad to tag along.

(Tannin mumbles something about feeding them to the manticores, but no one quite catches it.)

**Galadriel:** I’d love to hear more about what this Messenger has been up to in the past few months since we talked.

**Harlan:** Yes, I’ve been betrayed by a god myself recently, so I’m very interested.

They go into some detail about their original visit to Aberith, where they attended some meetings and became devout followers of what they call "The Message." In doing so, they have been sent to deliver various letters from one place to another. 

- Their job as they describe it (they are very proud of it) is to serve this great cause. 
- Everything that they’ve done sounds like they’re messenger boys. They are currently on a mission to deliver a message of great importance. 
- They don’t meet with the Messenger directly; this is correspondence between someone who teaches his message, and whoever they’re sent to go see. Not just a single set of people.
- Unrelatedly, we confirm that they were not in Aberith at the time of the Flats explosion.

**Nim:** So anyway, you said you're headed to a cave?

**Tannin:** Nah, never mind.

**Galadriel:** No, wait. Have you ever done missionary work with magical creatures? Do they need to understand the Message too?

**Harlan:** Yeah, have they been betrayed by the gods as well?

**Nim:** Everything on the planes has been betrayed by the gods, the creatures as well. We are entitled to freedom, and the gods prevent that.

**Harlan:** What can we do? I too am filled with a rage, btu I don’t konw how to channel it. Sometimes it seems the gods are so powerful that there’s nothing we can do.

**Nim:** Do you know the Message?

**Harlan:** No. We’ve only met you and a scant few other people who have even heard of the Messenger.

**Nim:** You look like someone who could use it.

He reaches into his satchel and pulls out one of several identical scrolls. He hands it to Harlan. It's filled with symbols for some language no one recognizes.

**Galadriel:** I can cast Comprehend Languages on this! Unless you both want to just read it to us?

**Nim:** The Message reveals itself in time.

**Harlan:** I’m going to keep this close to my heart and consult it when I’m in my hour of need.

**Nim:** Well, we'll be off, then, if you’re sure you don’t want us to tag along with you to that cave…

Tannin kicks a rock and says "Ehhh!!"

**Harlan:** Unfortunately I think not. Where are you headed?

**Nizana:** To Eillin!

**Galadriel:** Oh! Say hello to Mayor [Frunk](/characters/frunk/) for us. And bartender [Fleck](/characters/fleck/) with his gold coin eyes.

**Nim:** Oh, we’ve never been there.

**Galadriel:** Well... if you meet them... tell them we said hey.

They go on their way, indeed toward Eillin.

# Scouting the cave

Another hour passes on the road and we get to the clearing from the map. We see a wide mouth to a cave. It’s around sunset. 

- Are manticores nocturnal? Chunk says no, typically not. They might go to sleep soon. 
- Maybe we send [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) in now to poke around?

Hanamir casts Pass Without Trace, and the rest of us wait by the opening of the cave. He goes in. First thing that seems off: he finds a dead manticore. 

- It died a violent death, and something killed it fairly recently. 
- Immediate cause of death is slashing. Looks like slash marks from sets of three claws. That’s all he can tell.

He presses onward, and sees a scaled tail ahead past a corner, but then it moves away. He hears rustling, then some chewing sounds. He’s down about 400-500 feet in the cave now. As he goes deeper, the thing chewing comes into view. It looks sort of like a dragon: it has long, silverish wings, and a long tail. It doesn’t look quite like [Buddy](/characters/buddy/), but Hanamir can’t really tell for sure if it’s something else. It's similar in size to Buddy, like 80 feet long. It’s feasting on another dead manticore, this one larger than the previous corpse.

There are four side passages off the main chamber of the cave. Hanamir creeps back to the opening of the cave and reports back to the crew.

**Galadriel:** The last dragon we encountered was the shadow dragon who killed Harlan… so I'm a little wary.

**Harlan:** You don’t say!

**Chunk:** We could put it to sleep, if it’s full and a little drowsy. Give it a little lullaby. 

**Tannin:** How big would a manticore egg be, do you think? Based on the dead ones you saw. 

**Hanamir:** Maybe the size of a basketball.

- Important note: basketball exists in this universe, and Drephis State has a basketball team.

**Tannin:** OK, maybe go back into the other passages and if you find any eggs, bring them back?

**Chunk:** I could turn into a bat. And bring the Bag of Holding with me.

**Galadriel:** Can you turn into a manticore and lay an egg???

**Harlan:** Probably... not.

**Chunk:** Yeah, let me just turn into a bat.

**Galadriel:** The dragon might be able to tell you’re not really a bat, but you could get past it if you’re quick and nimble enough.

**Chunk:** Yeah, I’ll just go see what’s in the side passages.

**Tannin:** What happens if he gets eaten? If the dragon eats Chunk and the Bag of Holding, what happens to it? Does it explode?

(We do not have a satisfying answer to this question.)

Chunk turns into a bat and flies in. The dragon doesn’t notice him. He goes into each passageway succesively and finds:

- 1: a second one of these dragonlike creatures, slightly smaller, sleeping there. Nothing else of interest.
- 2: some sort of nursery. Three egg-shaped things in here. No animals.
- 3: two more slaughtered, partially-eaten manticores here.
- 4: empty. (A perception check reveals a small tunnel partially covered by stones that leads out the back of the cave. Would be big enough for the bat, but not for a firbolg.)

Chunk exits out this last exit and circles back to the party.

**Chunk:** Good news! There are three eggs in there. Bad news: there’s a second dragon thing. Should I go back in and try and gather the eggs?

**Galadriel:** If you think you can be stealthy enough, yeah! That could be our best bet. We won’t even have to fight.

**Harlan:** We should be ready at the entrance to cause a distraction if something goes wrong. You give us a signal or something.

# Short rest and scroll investigation

But before Chunk goes in again, we need to take a short rest. He can only do two shapeshifts per short rest. So we decide to rest and take a look at the scroll. Galadriel casts Comprehend Languages, but it doesn’t work. She arcana checks it; it’s not enchanted. But Nim said it revealed itself in time… what could this mean? Is “revealing itself in time” some kind of riddle? Will the codebreaker show up at daybreak, or at some time of day?

Hanamir points the Mirror of the Past at it. He sees a normal looking human man (not a person we recognize) staring at an engraving that has the same symbols as this, and he’s making a copy of it. We try to commit as much of this person to memory as we can, but there’s not much detail visible. 

We try to discuss Chunk’s contingency plan if he’s noticed by the dragons. He does have his teleportation ring, but that will take him all the way back to Snowmantle’s estate. He could Meld into Stone, but then would need us to rescue him. We decide our best fighters (Tannin and Hanamir) will be ready to jump into a fight if needed, but Galadriel and Harlan will hang back and potentially cause a distraction.

# Egg quest

Chunk turns into a bat and flies into the cave again. The dragon notices him this time, but doesn’t do anything at this point. He goes into the passageway with the eggs, and returns to his firbolg form. He puts the eggs into the Bag of Holding. As he finishes gathering them, he hears the two dragons making sounds at each other—just noises, not dragon speech (Draconic). Like they're animals. 

He turns back into a bat. In the main cave chamber, both dragon creatures are there, sniffing around. But this time, he’s not so lucky: the one that was asleep before makes a swipe at him with its claw. He’s immediately dropped and returns to his firbolg form! Whoops. He takes 7 damage.

As a firbolg, he can now recognize the creature: it’s a wyvern. It makes another attack with its stinging tail and hits again for 13 damage. Chunk screams in pain, and the rest of the party is now aware of his distress.

Galadriel decides to go for a distraction. She casts Minor Illusion to create a noise: she imitates a tasty, dying manticore. 

**Galadriel:** I'm so juicy and delicious! I’ve been bathing in teriyaki sauce for so long and now it’s my time to go!

The smaller wyvern is perched right on top of Chunk and takes a bite out of him for 19 damage. The other one is looking at him, and at that moment, hears a manticore returning to the cave, and it heads off in that direction (it is hearing Galadriel’s illusion).

Chunk turns invisible (Hidden Step). He will be invisible until the start of his next turn. He sprints away from the wyvern. This confuses the creature quite a bit. 

Hanamir uses Step of the Wind to run 135 feet. Tannin runs 70 feet into the cave.

**Tannin:** We're comin’, Chunk! Just hold on for 10 more rounds of combat!

Harlan readies a spell (Spirit Guardians). Galadriel also readies a spell (Bestow Curse). She climbs up to the ceiling of the cave in order to hopefully get the drop on a wyvern as it comes out.

The wyvern that bit Chunk is looking around in confusion, trying to figure out where he went. It can’t catch up to him, but it does smell him and is giving chase. The bigger wyvern is flying now, on its way out of the cave hoping to get a dying manticore as it enters the cave. 

Chunk continues running. Goes another 60 feet. Still carrying the eggs/Bag of Holding.

Hanamir comes up to the flying wyvern. He rolls a really good acrobatics check (25!) and does the fucking sickest slo-mo slide underneath the wyvern, dodging a swipe from its claw. Tannin runs another 70 feet, and prepares to duck under the wyvern, knowing it’s coming for him next. 

The smaller wyvern does not catch up to Chunk; in fact, it’s falling behind. Chunk is faster than it, even injured. 

The bigger wyvern stops as it sees Tannin front of it. Tannin tries to imitate Hanamir’s cool slide, but does a move more like a hot dog rolling on a table. He gets a decent amount of horizontal roll speed on it. The wyvern's immediate reaction is to swipe, but it misses. It also misses with its stinger tail, this time so badly that it tumbles and gets tangled in its own tail. It’s prone. (So is Tannin, but by choice.)

Chunk is now about midway out of the cave. He continues running, and passes Hanamir running the opposite direction. Hanamir gives him a pat on the back as he passes him and continues pursuing the smaller wyvern.

Tannin started going into a rage as he rolled underneath the wyvern. He pops back up now and attacks it twice with his trident while it remains prone. He does 26 total damage. 

The smaller wyvern catches up to Hanamir. It claws at him and hits, and also stings him with its tail, for total damage of 32. The bigger wyvern spends its turn getting upright, then makes a bite and sting attack at Tannin. The bite hits, the sting misses. Tannin takes 5 damage. 

Chunk keeps running. He’s about 100 feet from the exit at this point. He reaches the Tannin/wyvern fight.

Hanamir attacks the smaller wyvern and hits using Stunning Strike. The wyvern takes 9 piercing damage, and it’s stunned until the beginning of Hanamir’s next turn. He then runs away back toward the mouth of the cave.

Tannin is still fighting the bigger wyvern, now joined by Chunk. Uses reckless attack to hit; hits twice. Does another 19 damage. 

Harlan is still sort of hanging back, waiting for something to come out of the tunnel, but no luck. He can hear the bigger wyvern fight (Tannin’s a screamer). He runs into the cave now, facing his fear of dragon-like creatures for the sake of his friends. 

Galadriel continues sneaking along the ceiling. She’s trying to remain stealthy and doing well, but she’s slower because of it. 

The smaller wyvern is still stunned, it does nothing.

The bigger wyvern now sees Chunk entering the fray and Harlan coming form the other end. It makes a bite attack at Harlan for 9 damage. Its stinger attack goes for Tannin, and it hits. But he has advantage against poison, so he doesn’t take as much damage (5 piercing, 11 poison; these are half as much as he otherwise would take). 

Chunk casts Lightning on the bigger wyvern for 26 damage. The wyvern is looking in bad shape. 

Hanamir is now running out of the cave, not quite up to the bigger wyvern battle yet, but about halfway out. The smaller wyvern is now un-stunned. He continues running another 90 feet.

Tannin reckless attacks the larger wyvern, hitting twice. He does 26 damage. The wyvern now looks close to death.

Harlan is engaged with the wyvern in front of him, looking afraid but determined. He realizes he could take out some of his need for revenge on this creature. He’s scared out of his wits. He casts Inflict Wounds at a 2nd level; it hits quite effectively. The wyvern takes 18 necrotic damage and is dead! 

Harlan was in part desperation, part rage. His hammer is glowing with dark necrotic energy. As he smashes it into the wyvern's head, he watches as its skull collapses. He then spits on its corpse. We burst into applause. 

Something on his scroll begins to glow… a symbol changes, and he realizes it means “fight.”
