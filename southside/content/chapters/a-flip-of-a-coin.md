# Giving the scouts the slip

[Tannin](/characters/tannin/) and [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/), back with the two titan scouts at the river, decide that now is the time to break free. Galadriel casts Suggestion on them. 

**Galadriel:** If you guys can go rip up some trees over in that grove, it’d help us get more tiberium for you.

- This is complete bullshit.

They had been impressed by Tannin’s feat of bravery, so they’re extra-willing to comply. While they are occupied, we arrange evidence of a scuffle at the edge of the riverbank to suggest that we were eaten by the kraken. Once we are out of sight, we catch up with [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/). He envelops us in Pass Without Trace, and we're in the clear. 

Upon returning to the place they left us, the titans see the forged evidence of the kraken conflict. They shrug, and henceforth totally stop caring about us. 

- Yes!!! 
- Crushed it.

# Back in the city

After digging out from the tunnel, [Chunk](/characters/chunk/) and [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) and the survivors of the battle are out in the middle of nowhere. The surviving dwarves include three guardians. One of these reveals himself to be the king! Together, they teleport back to the Wandering City.

The party is soon reunited, as Galadriel, Tannin, and Hanamir make their way back to the city. 

**Galadriel:** Harlan, Chunk, we are *so* sorry you got enslaved. That must have been really rough. 

**Chunk:** It was.

- They tell us about their daring escape.

**Harlan:** Yeah, we have some good news, and some bad news.

- The good news is that they found the king.
- The bad news is that most of the dwarf prisoners died.

King Kolme is relieved to be back after all this time. He explains that he and some of the guardians were out investigating the titans when they were captured. Now he’s pretty emotional about all the deaths of his fellow prisoners. He brings Chunk and the other guardians into his chambers and declares that it's time to plan an all-out war on the titans to avenge their fallen comrades. 

**Chunk:** I think now’s not the time to make a decision like that. They fought with honor to save us; would they want the rest of us to die too? Think about it. How many dwarves died just fighting two femorians? What chance would we have against more?

The other guardians are swept up in the king’s emotions, and they side with him.

**Kolme:** We’ll bring the whole mountain down if we have to. We’re dwarves—we’ll find a way.

**Chunk:** All I ask is that we give it some time. Let’s not rush into this, or we might lose everyone.

Kolme is not convinced, but at least he’s not going to storm out and rally the troops this instant.

# The temptation of war

Hanamir surveys the dwarf population. It is large—a really large city with skyscrapers, so much bigger than Aberith or anything else we’ve seen. But a hundred dwarves vs two femorians turned out to be really, really hard. So he’s not thinking their odds would be good if all-out war broke out.

Thelatha is glad to have the king back. The loss of the other prisoners weighs heavily on the survivors but not really on everyone else; they had already been assumed dead long ago. She is disturbed by the idea of going to war with the titans.

Hanamir asks if she has seen any clowns; she replies that she hasn't. He suggests that they move the city (flip the coin) instead of going to war with the titans.

Do we need to catch the king up on twenty years of history? Thelatha will brief him on everything. The civilians don’t know he was ever gone, though it was rumored… and now he wants to make a speech riling up the citizens to go to war.

**Galadriel:** Does the king need to be involuntarily committed? Is he in shock?

**Tannin:** Or is he exactly *right?*

- Tannin loves the idea of taking down a race of giants.

**Tannin:** Do we wait for the titans to attack and enslave more dwarves, or do we attack first?

The emotions of the day are understandably high, and it’s really hard to steer people away from the idea of war once they latch onto it. Hanamir suggests having a candlelight vigil in memory of those who died in the escape, in interest of bringing the mood down a little bit. 

Meanwhile, Kolme checks that the newest guardian is good for his vow.

**Kolme:** You’re trying to talk us out of this, but will you fulfill your duty to the city if you are called to do so?

**Chunk:** Did you see me in those tunnels, fighting alongside you? Yes, I will.

# Vigil for the lost

Hanamir's suggested candlelight vigil is held at the cathedral of Moradin, a dwarven deity. King Kolme remains resolute in his determination that war with the titans is the only path forward.

**Kolme:** Many in this graveyard were killed by femorians in the past.

**Chunk:** Yes. May the others we left behind live on in memory along with them.

In an attempt to disrupt this line of thinking, Hanamir steps up to speak during the service.

**Hanamir:** Where I come from, Drephis, there's a story about a war that raged between dwarves and orcs for a long, long time. It was a generations-long, genocidal war—burnt wastelands in every direction. And it only ended when a wise dwarven king decided it had been enough suffering, enough bleeding, and that his people had had enough war. They buried the sword and the axe, and a new flowering culture bloomed forth. Better days came when the war was over.

- Is this a true story? We’re not sure. Hanamir says it is.

This works pretty well. Emotions are contagious. The audience here is the family members of people who had been assumed dead and are now actually known to be dead. Hanamir’s imposing presence and his words are effective. This particular group starts to chant “flip the coin.”

# Coin toss

The next day, we are summoned to King Kolme's quarters. He has decided that they will, indeed, flip the coin. The Feywild has been their home a long time, but it’s time to leave. 

He wants us to tell the citizens to prepare for a plane shift. This has historically been very dangerous, so it's important to prepare people. 

Galadriel writes a catchy pop song called "Flippin' That Coin," whose lyrics contain all the instructions about preparing for a plane shift. It warns about:

- nausea
- holding on to something sturdy
- securing one's valuables

It’s not a very good song and it doesn’t do well, but some people like it ironically. 

The time comes to flip the coin. The king asks the guardians, Thelatha, and the party to accompany him to the official chamber where the coin is kept. 

Hanamir, ever vigilant, has been watching out for any suspcious behavior. He determines that the most suspicious person around is, in fact, Thelatha—she’s oddly comfortable with all this, while most everyone else is nervous. We do know she’s a child born in the Shadowfell, which explains maybe why she’s less excitable than the others. 

The king flips the coin! 

... and ... 

We go to the Shadowfell! 

The flip is quite an experience. It feels incredibly bleak. There’s a lot of shaking, like a roof caving in. Everything goes dark; all the lights are extinguished. We hear anguished cries outside the doors. People are undergoing something bad. There are sounds of scraping, crushing, and wings flapping outside. At one point, a large rock formation shoots through the wall, nearly impaling Harlan, but narrowly missing him. 

The terrain here is different. If you’re unlucky or in the wrong place, something might kill you during the shift. After a couple minutes, the grinding stops.

# Mirror of the Past

In the immediate aftermath, Hanamir points the Mirror of the Past at the coin. 

- He sees a couple of flips of the coin. Some are very intentional, and some are accidental, before its powers were understood.
- There is also a vision from the material plane where there’s a guardian who wears the coin as a part of his ring. We see him walk into an ornate bedroom of someone of some importance. He slits their throat. And then he walks right through a wall out of that room!
- The coin, apparently, has some powers beyond plane-shifting.

# Hello darkness, my old friend

The guardians open the door and we go out to see the new plane we’ve emerged in. The sky is a uniform blanket of darkness. 

The damage outside isn’t quite as bad as expected. People are hurt, but overall the city is intact. People are sitting around in disbelief; it’s really jarring to go from the Feywild to the Shadowfell. Galadriel immediately amps up her goth look, applies more eyeliner, and sulks. 

We spend some time exploring the immediate surroundings outside the city. Outside, Hanamir does notice something hovering overhead. It's like when a cloud goes over the sun, but it’s already really dark. The third time this happens, Hanamir actually catches sight of it. Something is flying in circles overhead. It is paying particular attention to us, as if it knows we don’t belong. 

The immediate landscape surrounding the area is somewhat recognizable, like an odd echo of the Feywild and the  material plane. In the direction of the mountains there are now these large pillars of stone, like long strands of hair sticking out of the ground. In all other directions lies the flattest, dustiest terrain. As we step on some of the ground, it crumbles under our feet; nothing caves away fully, but it’s very brittle. It’s bleak.

We have a lot to ponder, a lot to brood about, and a lot to write sad poetry about.
