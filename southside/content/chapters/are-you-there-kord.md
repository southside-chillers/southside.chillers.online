The adventurers make their way back over the bridge to meet up with [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) and [Redyl](/characters/redyl/). The two are sitting on a bench and look to be deep in an animated conversation.

“...and that’s how I learned to ride dolphins into battle. It’s all in the knees!” Tannin says. He and Redyl both laugh. “Oh, hi guys.”

“How did your meeting go?” asks Redyl.

“Great!” says [Hermione](/characters/hermione/). She shows off the library passes and checkpoint passes that King Slee signed for them all. “We can research how to defeat the Lich in the royal library, and we can pass through the city without having to pretend to be diplomats.”

[The Savage](/characters/the-savage/) stares off into the distance.

“I’m going to go talk to some people about forming a militia,” he says.

“Didn’t the king tell you to wait until you could speak to the council?” says Hermione.

“Yeah,” says the Savage. There is a silence.

“So... if we need to get in touch with you, how should we do that?” asks [Harlan](/characters/harlan/).

“I don’t care,” says the Savage. 

“We can sense your Ring of Been using the ones we have,” says [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/). “And then Hermione can Skywrite to you, if that’s necessary.”

“I guess,” says the Savage. He walks off without saying goodbye.

“Well,” says Redyl, after a moment, “I’m afraid I’ll be taking my leave of you all now, too. I have cousins here, in the Gillyheart neighborhood, whom I’d like to see. I—I can’t thank you enough for all you’ve done for me.” He chokes up a little.

“Aw, Redyl,” says [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/). “Enjoy your family time! I’m sure we’ll meet again. We’ll be on the lookout for Rompit.”

Redyl bows deeply and gives them a tiny wave before disappearing into the crowded street. 

“That guy is cool. I hope he finds his baby,” says Tannin. Nobody corrects him. He gives the bundled basilisk a shake. “Where to now? Back to the Kiln to sell this?”

“I would like to stop by the Temple of Wind, just to see if there’s anything my fellow Kord followers can do about appendage loss,” says Harlan.

“Plan,” says Hanamir.

They head back to one of the impressive towers they saw during their walk to the palace. It looks like a service is just ending; several worshippers in simple attire are leaving through the front gate. Harlan makes sure his holy symbol is centered on the chain around his neck and leads them in. A few people are still milling about, and one of them is dressed as a cleric. Harlan approaches her and bows while making the Sign of Lightning.

“Under the Eye of the Storm,” he says. 

“May we behold His Fury,” she says, bowing back. “I’m sorry to say you’ve just missed today’s service, but I am always happy to welcome a devotee of the Storm. Are you from out of town? I haven’t seen you here before.”

“Yes, my friends and I have just traveled up from Eillin,” says Harlan. “I’m glad to see that reverence for Kord is alive and well in the city.”

“We are blessed, indeed,” says the woman. “Lovely to meet you. I’m Deru Nyanceth, priestess of this temple.”

“Harlan Stormborne. I came to pay my respects and admire this monument to He Whose Fists Are Thunder, which—by the way—is gorgeous,” says Harlan. “It has clearly flourished under your care. But I also have a request. Thanks be to Kord, we were recently able to defeat a tremendous foe, but in that process, I found myself… shorthanded.”

He holds up his wrist stump.

“I was wondering if you could put me in touch with someone skilled in the arts of regeneration, so that I may more effectively enact Kord’s will.”

“Ah, yes, of course,” says Deru. “Regeneration is indeed a service we offer here at the temple. Many of our followers work in the shipyards, so such injuries are not uncommon. This spell does require one hundred gold pieces’ worth of diamond dust, which we can provide for you if you do not have it. The casting service itself is five hundred gold. So, all told, it would cost six hundred gold to regrow your hand.”

“Dang!” crows Tannin. “Now we really gotta sell the basilisk, huh?”

“Basilisk?” says Deru, with some alarm.

“Oh, yeah, uh, ‘sell the basilisk’ is just a... Dwarvish turn of phrase,” says Harlan. “He means we need to find a way to make some gold, that’s all.”

“Okay,” Deru says.

“Anyway, that sounds very reasonable. As soon as I can come up with it, I’ll be back,” says Harlan. “In the meantime, would you happen to have a recommendation for a good place to stay in the city?”

“Sure. In Silver Hill, the Prismatic Inn is the place to go, though it’ll run you five gold a night,” she says. “A more affordable but still pleasant option is the Half-Full Flagon. It’s an inn above a tavern of the same name, down in Southgate.”

“Thank you,” says Harlan. “We’ll check that out.”

“Be careful, though! Don’t take a wrong turn and end up in the Kiln,” says Deru.

“Oh yes, we’d been meaning to ask about that, too,” says Harlan. “We’ve heard that people have been going missing from that area, right?”

“Well, from the Kiln, that’s nothing new,” she says. “But the recent disappearances have been from all over the city. One of our patrons has a daughter who went missing just two weeks ago.”

“May I ask—does the daughter have any magical powers?” asks Hermione.

“Not that I know of,” says Deru. “And her father is a simple shipbuilder, so there’s no chance of a high ransom, or anything like that.”

“Perhaps we might speak to this patron tomorrow,” says Hanamir.

“Ern Sailbright is his name, if you’d like to do that,” says Deru. “He works down in the shipyards, as I said. You’d find him there.”

“Would you say it’s mostly young people who have gone missing?” asks Galadriel.

“I think it’s primarily people who are vulnerable, and that often includes the young,” sighs Deru. “It’s been people who go off on their own and don’t come back.”

“One last question, if you’ll indulge us out-of-towners,” says Harlan. “We heard a rumor on our way into the city about a demagogue who is turning people against the gods. He’s called the Messenger. Do you know of him?”

At this, Deru looks yet more dismayed.

“Yes, I have heard whisperings of this Messenger,” she says. “We’ve seen a slight drop in attendance, too. With all the difficult news lately, some people feel that the gods have turned against them. My father is a member of the king’s ministry, and I’ve asked to see if he can do anything to address this growing sentiment. But, to be blunt, he’s probably the least influential member of the ministry right now.”

“What’s his area of expertise?” asks Galadriel.

“He’s the Minister of the Sea. His name is Haelon Nyanceth.”

“So do you think anything will come of it?” says Galadriel.

“I’m not sure. My dad may not have…” Deru pauses. “Um, it’s tough to talk about my dad.”

“I’m sorry,” says Galadriel. “I understand if you’d rather not.”

“I’m just not sure he’s himself anymore. He used to be the Minister of War, and now he’s switched to the Ministry of the Sea, and ever since then, he hasn’t been the same.” 

“Pressures of the job, or something else?” asks Harlan.

“He’s getting old. It might just be that,” says Deru. Her eyes flicker to the ground and back up, then widen as she notices Galadriel’s gauntlet. “Hey. What’s that there, on your arm?”

“Oh!” Galadriel holds up her arm. “This? Just a protective gauntlet I found during our travels. I’m an archer, you see.”

“Okay,” says Deru. “As long as it keeps you safe, I guess.”

“It does! Prevents so many wrist wounds while nocking arrows, you wouldn’t believe it!”

“All right, all right, that’s enough now,” says Harlan. He turns Galadriel around by the shoulders and starts guiding her toward the exit. “Great to meet you, Deru. Thank you for all your help.”

The sun is starting to set as they leave the temple. They decide to start toward the neighborhood of Southgate to see if the Half-Full Flagon can accommodate them for the night. It isn’t difficult to find: once they’re in the area, they can hear the sounds of music and carousing from a well-lit establishment right at a central street corner. 

“Five silver a night for a bed,” the innkeeper informs them when they arrive.

“Tell you what, I’ll part with two and a half,” says Tannin, “because I’m half size.”

The innkeeper laughs.

“A bed is a bed,” he says. “If you want to pay less, there are other places to stay.”

“No, no, he’ll pay five,” says Hermione. 

They check into their rooms. Tannin and Hanamir take fifteen minutes to stuff the basilisk corpse in the magical mini-fridge. Some rope is required to tie the thing shut, but they succeed. Now sweating from the effort, they go downstairs to the tavern to join the others. 

Unsurprisingly, Galadriel is already lying down on the bar having shots poured into her mouth by a beleaguered-looking bartender. Harlan and Hermione are sitting nearby, sipping their drinks and pretending they don’t know her. Hanamir and Tannin pull up chairs to their table.

“I think we should take this opportunity to ask around about the Messenger,” says Harlan. “Hanamir, can you try using Thieves’ Cant? And Tannin, can you use Undercommon?”

Hanamir obliges and disappears into the crowded room. Tannin, on the other hand, is glancing longingly at the table of other dwarves doing drinking challenges in the corner. 

“Fine,” he says. He shuffles around the room saying, “G’day, mate… g’day mate…” but it’s clear his heart isn’t in it. 

Hanamir returns in a short while, shaking his head.

“Not a lot of thieves in this establishment,” he says. “At least none who wanted to speak with me.”

Tannin does not return, and instead can be seen at the table of dwarves showing off his trident. His voice carries.

“Yeah, axes are cool, but this thing takes people by surprise, you know? Sure, you can hold it.”

They then observe him making a bet with a drunk dwarf that he can hold his breath the longest with beer in his mouth. He pockets ten copper pieces this way as he challenges everyone at the table, winning easily.

Galadriel now stands up on the bar and leads the tavern in an energizing rendition of a popular drinking song before leaping off and crowd surfing while still shredding on her lute. 

“I hope she’s still able to function tomorrow,” says Harlan. “I did see some kind of hangover curing potion in the market earlier, but it looked expensive. We don’t have the money to waste.” 

“Speaking of money,” says Hermione. “How are we going to raise the money for your hand? Will the basilisk even cover it?”

“The man from the Kiln offered two-fifty, but I’d still need another three-fifty on top of that,” says Harlan, sounding resigned.

“Well, you can have all my silver,” says Hermione. She pushes him the small pouch of coins that she found in the cell next to hers in orc prison. “It’s not much, but…”

“Aw,” Harlan smiles. “Thank you. I appreciate it.”

Hanamir goes up to the bar and returns with a massive sandwich.

“Just a nightcap,” he says. “That was the last thing I wanted to buy, at least for now. I have four hundred gold, Harlan, and you can have it.”

“What?! Are you serious?” 

“Of course, man.” Hanamir smiles and looks down at the table, as if he’ll be embarrassed if Harlan makes a big deal out of it.

“I don’t know what to say. Thank you so much, Hanamir. I’ll find a way to pay you back—installments, or—”

“Sure, sure,” Hanamir waves a hand. “We need two-handed Harlan back if we’re going to defeat the Lich.” He takes a bite out of his sandwich and chews it thoughtfully. “Smoked auroch, apparently. It’s good, but nothing compares to that mystery meat from the Lolth tower.”

The tavern slowly empties out as the night lengthens. The adventurers are some of the last to retire, in part because Galadriel insists on improvising a sonnet for the bartender for facilitating her excellent evening. But eventually, they all make it upstairs to their rooms and pass a restful night without incident or interruption.

---

The morning is not kind to Galadriel. 

“Come on, time to get up,” says Harlan. “Have some water.”

“Nooooooooooo,” she groans, but gulps down the proffered water before burrowing back into her pillows.

After a considerable amount of wheedling, Galadriel is persuaded to face the day, but she looks as if she’s been hit by a battering ram.

“All right,” says Hermione. “Who wants to come to the library with me? We’ll figure out what the basilisk corpse could be used for, and if it’d be more valuable to sell it as-is or in pieces… and then, I’d like to do some reading about tieflings before our meeting with Magic.”

Hanamir raises his hand. Galadriel grunts.

“Great. I’m going to go to the market to see if I can find a good deal on that diamond dust, and maybe save some gold that way,” says Harlan.

“I’ll go with you,” says Tannin eagerly, seeming to jump at any alternative to library time.

“Meet back up at the library steps in two hours?” says Hermione.

Harlan nods, and the two groups part ways.

At the royal library, the librarian accepts their passes from King Slee with some surprise.

“Three new scholars in a day! Most unusual,” says the librarian, ushering them inside. “How can I help?”

Hanamir and Hermione seem to have departed the mortal plane, struck dumb by the sight of the library. Spiral staircases and arched bridges connect the many levels of bookshelves that look down on the wide floor. 

“My friend here is a renowned scholar of magical creatures,” says Galadriel, indicating Hermione. “She’s writing a book about basilisks, and we were hoping that a city with a library of this caliber might have some research materials for her work.”

“Of course. One moment please; I’ll fetch you some selections on basilisks,” says the librarian. He bounds up one of the spiral staircases with the confidence of a goat scaling a salt cliff. The adventurers sit down at one of the long wooden tables on the ground floor. The librarian returns moments later with *Staring at Basilisks: An Eyeless Man’s Perspective* and *Stone Cold, Hot Commodity: The Untold Story of the Underground Basilisk Trade*.

“These should be a great start, but let me know if you need more material,” says the librarian.

“Thank you,” says Hermione. She wastes no time cracking open *Stone Cold, Hot Commodity*. “All right, it says here that the most valuable part of a basilisk is this gland that produces the material that petrifies things. Also the eyes, but more as trophies…. The gland can be processed in a number of ways to create petrification potions or antivenoms to protect against petrification, or to cure petrification after the fact. It is most commonly consumed as a potion.”

“So would it be more valuable to just sell the whole thing, or to try and make a potion out of that gland and sell it?” asks Galadriel.

“I’m not sure… that Kiln guy did say he’d pay more for any future basilisks we might find, but I don’t know how likely it is that we’ll come across another one,” says Hermione.

Hanamir has been perusing *Staring at Basilisks* during this time, and speaks up.

“It says here that basilisks are most commonly found in the far western woods. It’s actually quite unusual that we ran into one where we did,” he says. 

“Their eggs are also valuable,” says Hermione. “Apparently, some people try to raise them from birth, and train them not to look at you. Huh! And… they eat stone. So when they petrify things, they usually eat them afterward, and that gland helps them digest it.”

“Any detail on how exactly the gland can be turned into an antivenom, or…?” says Galadriel.

“Not so far,” says Hermione.

“My gut tells me we’re better off selling the whole thing than attempting advanced potion-making without guidance,” says Hanamir. 

While they continue to read, Galadriel tiptoes over to the librarian. 

“Do you have any books on dragons?” she whispers.

“Many,” says the librarian. “Chromatic, metallic, what kind are you interested in?”

“Um,” says Galadriel. “Are the metallic ones… shiny? Like metal?” 

“Uh, yeah,” says the librarian.

“Then… those,” she says. “Please. Thanks!”

The librarian returns with a tome entitled *Bahomet’s Children*. Galadriel tries to bring it back to the table and sit down without drawing attention to herself, but Hermione looks up at the hefty volume with curiosity.

“What’s that?” she asks.

“Oh, just, um…” But in a rare moment, Galadriel is at a loss for words. “It’s about dragons.”

“Huh? Why?”

“Well, we know Magic stole a book about dragons from Bryn,” says Galadriel, thinking quickly. “A dragon destroyed her home. Maybe I can learn something relevant to that before our meeting.”

Hanamir raises his eyebrows but continues reading.

“Hmmmm,” says Hermione. “Well, I’m going to ask for a book about tiefling society, so that I’m culturally sensitive when I meet her.”

Galadriel scans through *Bahomet’s Children*. The good news, she learns right away, is that most metallic dragons are good; the evil ones tend to be chromatic. But what kind of metallic dragon is [Buddy](/characters/buddy/)? He seemed to glow with a warm, yellowish light, but that might have been gold, or bronze, or copper…

She flips to the section about copper dragons. 

*They enjoy constructing cave lairs with mazes designed to cause confusion… fond of puzzles, jokes, and elaborate pranks…*

*Welp*, she thinks. *That is definitely Buddy. Case closed.*

She reads on.

*Razor-sharp talons and teeth… gargantuan wingspan… cone of poisonous gas... breath of acid...*

Her stomach does a swan dive to the floor. Is it possible that Buddy could have been the one to destroy Magic’s home and kill all her people? 

Yes, certainly, that is possible.

She shuts the book.

Harlan and Tannin wander the bustling market near the royal library. 

“All right, we’re looking for a jeweler who might have some diamond dust,” says Harlan. “And, hopefully, someone who’s willing to cut me a deal due to my unfortunate circumstances.”

Tannin stops in his tracks to ogle a knife seller’s booth. 

“Look at these,” he murmurs, gazing at his reflection in a fanned display of wicked-looking blades.

“Five hundred gold for the set,” says the seller. “A rare bargain for this level of quality.”

“Oooooh,” says Tannin. “Should I?”

“What? You can’t afford that,” says Harlan.

“Ha. Don’t be so sure.” Tannin tosses him his pouch of gold. “Count it!”

“Uh,” says Harlan. “There are… maybe thirty gold pieces in here, Tannin.”

“Oh,” says Tannin. He shrugs. “Well, you can have it, then. For the diamonds.”

They walk on until they come across a jeweler’s tent with many rows of glittering gems. Harlan addresses the posh, bespectacled man behind the counter.

“Do you sell diamond dust?” he asks.

“We sell diamonds,” says the jeweler. 

“Of course, of course. Hey, just wondering, do you know how large a diamond I’d need to grind in order to make up a hundred gold pieces’ worth of dust?” 

“What? We don’t do that here.”

“Right, but what about when you’re cutting the diamonds? Do you have any diamond dust from that?”

“Our diamonds start at four hundred gold apiece,” says the jeweler, sliding his glasses up the bridge of his nose. “You might not be in the right place, sir.”

“Aha. I see.” 

Harlan does an about-face, looking a little flustered, and he and Tannin continue walking amongst the stalls.

“This is for a spell, right?” says Tannin. “Maybe there’s a magic supply store.”

“Yes, it’s for a spell!” sighs Harlan, waving his stump. “I’m trying to get my hand back, remember?”

“You could try there,” Tannin says, pointing at a storefront labeled *Zoinks! Arcane Goods*. Compared to the rest of the market, it looks a little shabby.

“Might as well,” says Harlan.

The two of them enter the shop. It smells of mildew and neglect. A gnome with an unkempt beard swivels on his stool behind the counter to peer at them as they walk in.

“Hi there,” says Harlan. “Do you, by any chance, happen to sell diamond dust?”

“I do indeed, sir,” says the gnome. He hops down from the stool and disappears into a back room, returning a moment later with a large canister and a set of scales. “How much you need?”

“Well,” says Harlan, “how much would usually cost a hundred gold pieces? I’m afraid that’s all I have to go on.”

The gnome uses a scoop to transfer some shimmering dust onto one side of the scales and places a few perfectly rounded pebbles on the other side. 

“About this much,” says the gnome. “That’ll be a hundred gold, please.”

“Is there any chance you could give me a discount?” asks Harlan. “I lost my hand… I’m on a noble mission to save the world, and…the temple, they said they could heal me...” His voice falters.

“Now, see here,” says the gnome. “If you don’t buy this dust, I know someone at the temple will.”

“That’s a good point,” says Harlan, exhaling loudly, in apparent defeat.

“So why should I make a deal with you, huh?”

“You know what? Never mind. I’ll just go,” says Harlan. “Come on, Tannin.”

As if to teach the gnome some obscure lesson about not granting discounts arbitrarily to strangers, Tannin punches a display of small pouches of sand on his way out.

“I guess I’m better off just paying the temple extra for the diamond dust,” says Harlan. 

“Yeah, probably,” says Tannin. “Oh, wait. Would you mind staying out here for a second? I’m going to go back in. I need to see if he has something. It’s personal.”

“You just punched a display—” starts Harlan, but the tiny bell on the door is already announcing Tannin’s re-entrance.

“Hey,” says Tannin to the gnome, who is putting the sand pouch display back together forcefully. 

“What do you want?” asks the gnome.

Tannin leans against a glass case full of carved wooden statuettes.

“I’m looking for a health potion,” he says, eyebrows raised, arching his fingers.

“We got those,” says the gnome tersely. “Potion of healing, potion of greater healing.”

“What’s greater healing?”

“Healing, but twice as effective.”

“Okay, how much?”

“A hundred gold for the regular, two hundred for the greater,” says the gnome. He dusts himself off and returns to his stool behind the counter.

“Oh,” says Tannin. “I just learned I can’t afford that. But… do you have anything that would protect against infernal creatures? Creatures of demonic origin? From down deep below? And is it cheaper than the healing potions?”

“Oh yeah, absolutely,” says the gnome, arching an eyebrow. He looks suddenly eager to make a deal. “Protection from infernals, you said? I could sell you an amulet. You looking for an amulet? Magical amulet?”

At this point, Harlan barges in, and the bell over the door is knocked off its post and clangs to the floor. 

“Sorry, sorry, I believe my companion misspoke,” he says. “We were just looking for a place to find more information about infernal creatures, not a magical object of any kind. Perhaps a book? A library?”

“There is a giant library across the street,” says the gnome, deadpan.

“Ohhhh of course! How silly of us,” says Harlan. He grabs Tannin’s wrist and drags him toward the door. “Come on, Tannin, let’s go find that information you wanted.”

Once they’re outside, Tannin wriggles free.

“What the hell, man?” he says, glaring. “That guy was about to sell me a magical amulet that I, like, really need!”

“He was trying to entrap you! It’s against the law to buy and sell magical items in the city right now! Come on!” 

“Wait, what?” says Tannin.

“Yes! It’s completely illegal. We didn’t tell you?” 

“No!” says Tannin.

“Well,” says Harlan, “I’m sorry, then.”

“And—and *by the way*, it’s not cool that you were listening to me even after I said it was personal,” says Tannin, a little red in the face. “I’m a very private person! I’ve said so before!”

“You have,” says Harlan. “I’m sorry. I was just trying to look out for you.” He takes a deep breath. “Well, this was a complete bust. Come on, let’s go join up with the others at the library.”

---

When Tannin and Harlan enter the library, they see Hermione, Galadriel, and Hanamir hunched in a close circle at one of the study tables, whispering fervently. They fall silent as the other two adventurers approach.

“Hey guys,” says Harlan, searching their faces for clues. “Everything all right?”

“Uhhhhhhh,” Hermione starts, with a wide-eyed glance at Galadriel. “I’ll let her tell you. How’d your market trip go?”

“Not great,” says Harlan heavily. “Galadriel? What’s going on?”

Galadriel bites her lip. 

“I couldn’t keep it from you all any longer,” she says. “I… I told them the truth about Buddy. What he is.”

“And?!” Harlan exclaims, prompting a loud "shhhhh!" from the librarian in the opposite corner.

“He’s a dragon,” whispers Galadriel. “A copper dragon, I think.”

“Oh, *Kord*.” 

“I hope he’ll forgive me for telling you. It was something he revealed to me in confidence,” says Galadriel. She looks down at the book in front of her. “But if I’m right, and he’s a copper dragon, then he’s not a danger to us… I mean, I already knew that he wasn’t, but if it makes you feel better, his type of dragon is generally good.”

“Oh, sure, Galadriel, that makes me feel sooOOOooo much better!” says Harlan. The librarian shushes him again. “How are you so sure we haven’t been wandering around with a mature chromatic dragon? He saw us kill the Wyrmling! Is he okay with that? He could be biding his time, waiting for the perfect moment to roast us in vengeance—”

“No, no, I saw him. He’s definitely metallic, not chromatic,” says Galadriel. “I’m just worried that he may have been, um, the dragon who destroyed Magic’s village.”

“You saw him? How big was he?” asks Hanamir.

“Big. He said he’s around six hundred years old,” says Galadriel.

“What?!” Harlan yelps, and the librarian comes over to the table.

“Sir, I am going to have to ask you to leave,” says the librarian. “This is a place for quiet study.”

“Oh, we’re on our way out,” says Harlan. “Don’t worry.”

“But hey, Galadriel, copper dragons don’t do fire, right?” says Hermione. “The dragon who did all the tiefling murders—that was a fire-breathing dragon, if we’re to go by the evidence of the burning forest.”

“I wish I could be sure,” says Galadriel.

“No, that’s a valid point,” says Hanamir. “Copper dragons have acid breath.”

“He might be gold!” says Galadriel. “I don’t know, I only saw him for a second…”

“Nah, I’m not worried,” says Hanamir. He reluctantly stacks the books on the table and gives the librarian a nod. “Thank you, friend. We’re sorry for the noise.”

“Hmph,” says the librarian. He takes the pile of books and stalks off to re-shelve them.

Outside, the sun is almost directly overhead. The sound of bells can be heard in the distance.

“Harlan, I think it’s time,” says Hanamir cheerfully. “Shall we go to the Kord temple and grow you a new hand?”

“Yes, please,” says Harlan. “I need *something* to go right today, Kord willing.”

At the Temple of Wind, they find Deru Nyanceth tending to a flourishing rose garden in the inner courtyard.

“Under the Eye of the Storm!” she calls to them with a wave.

“May we behold His Fury,” says Harlan. The other adventurers see his worried face relax into a smile. 

“Are you here to regenerate your hand?” asks Deru. She puts down her garden shears and wipes her brow.

“I am,” says Harlan. With a grateful look at Hanamir, he brings the requisite gold to Deru and hands it to her. 

“How very exciting,” says Deru. “We are happy to serve you, Harlan Stormborne, and to heal you by the power of Kord. Please come with me to the temple.”

She leads them into the nave and instructs Hermione, Tannin, Galadriel, and Hanamir to find a seat. She gestures for Harlan to follow her to the altar. 

“This ritual will take about an hour to complete,” she says. “I will have one of my monks fetch me the diamond dust, unless you brought some of your own.”

“I didn’t,” says Harlan. Deru nods at a monk behind the altar, who disappears to a store room.

“Very well. And, to confirm, you would like your new hand to grow out of your left wrist here?” asks Deru.

“Uh,” says Harlan. “Yes please.”

“Just checking,” she smiles. “We like to account for all kinds. Sometimes we get folks with unfamiliar anatomy here, and it never hurts to ask.”

“That’s very considerate,” says Harlan.

The monk returns with a small bowl of glittering powder. 

“Are you ready?” asks Deru.

“Yes,” says Harlan. 

“Good,” says Deru.

She reaches into the bowl of diamond dust and throws a handful onto the altar. A blast of thunder rips through the temple, shaking its foundations and causing the many wind chimes that hang from the ceiling to erupt with eerie, reverberating noise. Deru begins to chant:

*Lord of Thunder, God of Storms,*

*King of Tempests in all forms,*

*We call thee now, we seek thy aid,*

*To make whole that which was unmade!*

*Blizzard frozen, Cyclone screaming,*

*Whirlwind, Cloudburst, Downpour streaming,*

*Hear our cry, our sole demand:*

*Restore to Harlan his left hand!*

---

An hour later, the adventurers stand at the gate of the temple.

“Now, let’s see you wave that hand goodbye!” Deru laughs, walking them out. 

Harlan stretches his new fingers and gives her an energetic wave.

“It’s so *soft*,” he marvels. “And… pink!”

“Yes, that’ll fade soon enough,” says Deru. “But you’ll have to build up those calluses again from scratch, I’m afraid.” 

“My trusty maul will make quick work of that,” says Harlan. He cannot stop beaming. “I have two hands! What a day!”

“Come back again soon, all right?” says Deru as the adventurers step back into the city streets. Harlan waves again, just for the novelty of it.

“Well, I have to say, that was pretty cool,” says Tannin. “I have been to religious services before, and they are not usually that wild.”
