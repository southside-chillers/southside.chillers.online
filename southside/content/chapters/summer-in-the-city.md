The Half-Full Flagon is quite empty during the day. Its only occupant is a man with an unkempt beard who sits slumped behind the bar, snoring softly. The bell on the door isn’t enough to rouse him when the adventurers come in, but this does not discourage [Tannin](/characters/tannin/).

“What do you think, guys? A round of ales?” He kicks the bar and its attendant sputters awake.

“It’s not even noon yet,” says [Harlan](/characters/harlan/).

“So?” Tannin scoffs. “A pint of your finest, if you would.” The bartender yawns and acquiesces.

“I’ll pass,” says [Hermione](/characters/hermione/), pursing her lips. “I have some research I’d like to do regarding the Northern Ruins, and I don’t want to waste any time. I just want to get to our rooms upstairs, grab a change of clothes, and then get back to the library.”

“We do have a few weeks, according to the king,” says [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/). “You know, for a port city, it takes them a long time to charter a ship.”

“Unless it’s being done in the dead of night to make prisoners disappear,” notes [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/). 

“No takers? Really?” says Tannin, as the bartender sets down his ale. He then chugs the entire pint in one go. To an outside observer, this might be impressive, but the adventurers watch him without comment. “Fine. Do what you want. I have plans of my own.”

Galadriel has two items on her to-do list for her free time in Aberith:

1. Look up any records on her father, a human named Jeff “Bubba” Torpleton

2. Find a short-term gig

The first item is infinitely more important than the second, and it’s why she hasn’t mentioned it to her friends even once. In the sweltering heat of the early afternoon, she walks to the Hall of Public Records on the southern waterfront. A clerk, wearing thick spectacles and an unflattering dress made of something like burlap, handles her request.

“Torpleton, with a T?” says the clerk. “Follow me.” Galadriel follows her downstairs to a musty room of shelved scrolls, leather-bound books, and loose parchment.

“Here you go,” says the clerk, pulling a dank-smelling volume from a shelf.

“Thank you,” says Galadriel. She waits for the clerk to leave before even glancing at the book’s spine. *Heroique Soldieres of Aberythe’s Past*. Promising!

*TORPLETON, Greggorye. Knowne to friends as “Old Gregg.” Thys valiante soldiere fought for the Crowne of Aberythe under Her Majestye Resia II. During the Battle of Twelve Swordes, he led a party of humans against undead hordes at the Hillock Graves & vanquished the hideouse foes & lost but three of his owne soldieres. Afterward, the TORPLETONS pursued a quiette life of farminge to the west of the Elven City Ang’Svin.*

Galadriel feels her face fall. That’s all? Nothing more current? She flips through the book in vain. She doesn’t have a good idea of when Resia II’s reign took place, but it must have been hundreds of years ago, judging by the book alone. And he moved his family to Ang’Svin… well, she supposes, it’s better than nothing. It’d explain his great-great-great-great-grandson’s comfort level with elves. 

Still, she can’t deny her disappointment. She wanders back in the direction of the Half-Full Flagon, but doesn’t feel like seeing friends right now. Out of curiosity, she continues onward to the Kiln, past the daytime dealers of potions and the shadowy figures with nothing good to say. Without knowing why, she stops at a doorway marked by a painted black unicorn. *FOOD - DRINK - MUSIC*, the doorway proclaims. *NOW HIRING*, adds a hastily-scrawled piece of parchment.

Worth a shot for that second item on the list, she thinks.

Hanamir and Hermione don’t need to discuss other options before immediately venturing uptown to the library. It’s the obvious destination. Where else would an intelligent person spend their free time before a dangerous mission? 

They walk together across the entire city, making cordial conversation at an extra-polite distance. They attract a few stares from the general public—an elf woman and a half-orc man are an unusual pairing anywhere, but they feel particularly scrutinized in a majority-human city like Aberith.

“So, you are planning on researching the Northern Ruins?” asks Hanamir. 

“Yes,” says Hermione. “I have a baseline familiarity, but I am hoping to learn enough to help us navigate the ruins in pursuit of [Magick](/characters/magick/)’s dragon-slaying relic.”

“Very good,” says Hanamir. “Do keep me apprised of what you learn. I have a small chore to attend to first, but then I’d like to do some research myself.”

The librarian greets them coldly—he recognizes them as part of the group he had to eject the other day for excessive noise. But he warms up after the first five minutes watching the two of them behave like model citizens.

Hermione looks on as Hanamir takes a roll of parchment and a pen out of his backpack. He writes in a cramped but meticulously neat hand.

*To my colleagues at Drephis State University Library,*

*I write to you from the Royal Library of Aberith after weeks in pursuit of our missing shipment of Interlibrary Loan books, No. 404. I regret to report that the majority of the books remain unaccounted for at the time of this writing.*

*During my travels, I have had three encounters that did help to illuminate the search. I relate them to you here:*

*1. During the famed Moon Festival held in the town of Eillin, an intoxicated individual told of an orc encampment nearby that had been hastily evacuated. Among the abandoned items described therein were some books, which struck the individual as unusual, owing to orcs’ stereotyped aversion to literacy. Upon visiting this encampment myself, I was only able to recover a single page of what I recognized immediately as* The Reproductive Cycle of the Slaad. *Though I lack hard evidence, I do suspect this page came from DSU’s copy of the book.*

*2. In a nearby temple to the orc god Shargaas, my companions and I found DSU’s own marked copy of* Anatomy of Bugbears, Second Edition. *It had been desecrated, its pages entirely hollowed out. Forgive me—I know this is painful to read about. It was quite devastating to see in person.* 

*3. [Khargol](/characters/khargol/), a leader of Shargaas-aligned orcs, delivered a few oblique taunts regarding my quest to recover the Interlibrary Loan shipment. He called me a “delivery boy” and mentioned that I “didn’t even know what I was carrying.” This, and the hollowed-out copy of* AoB2E, *suggests to me that the books are being used for some unsavory purpose by the cult of Shargaas, perhaps as vessels to transport the magical tuning forks they have been using to plane-shift into the Sealed City.* 

*The trail has since gone cold, but I have not given up. These books are my responsibility. Accounting for them and seeking justice for their theft and/or destruction is my sacred duty.*

*Yours professionally and in deep, unyielding sorrow,*

*Hanamir*

Hermione watches as he then copies this same text over twice, separates the three copies, and seals two of them with wax. The third he tucks into his backpack. 

“Be right back,” he whispers, and slips away toward the stacks. He and the librarian then have an animated but essentially silent conversation resulting in Hanamir handing over the other two copies of his letter, and the two of them shaking hands warmly.

Hermione turns back to her pile of books. *Ixquichpehua: History and Myth* is the one she’s starting with. A quick glance at the table of contents gives her the beginnings of a headache.

*Part I: A Magical Empire*

*The Worship of Animal Gods, p. 1*

*Cursed Shrines, Enchanted Treasures, p. 56*

*A Legacy of Eternal Torment, p. 94*



*Part II: Modern Exploration*

*A Short List of Failed Voyages, p. 125*

*Known Traps, p. 151*

*Vengeful Guardians, p. 233*

She wonders if any of the other books might be a little more encouraging in their content. But their titles, if possible, sound worse:

*Divine Electrocution: The Eel God of Ixquichpehua*

*Buried Alive: Greed and the Search for Ixquichpehua’s Forbidden Treasures*

*It’s Just Not Worth It: The Case for Leaving the Northern Ruins Alone*

She decides to save those for later.

Harlan finds Deru Nyanceth in the temple garden filling a basket with herbs. She notices him and smiles widely.

“Under the Eye of the Storm!” she calls. “How’s that hand holding up?”

“May we behold His Fury,” says Harlan. He waves his left hand at her. “No complaints so far.” He glances around. “Isn’t there a service soon? I didn’t mean to interrupt. I was hoping to spend some time in communion with Kord, and with other devotees, of course.”

“Oh, yes,” says Deru, wiping her brow. “I’m cutting it close, aren’t I? Today’s service starts in a few minutes, so you’re right on time. I’ll come in with you now.”

“Also… I did want to tell you,” says Harlan. He looks down at the ground for a moment. “I met your father. He seemed…” 

“Confused?” sighs Deru. “Doddering? Unfit to hold office?”

She leads him to a side door of the temple and starts preparing for priestess duty: washing her hands, donning a gray cloak, affixing her holy symbol to her chest.

“I don’t know about that,” says Harlan. “But I tried Detecting Magic on him, and—”

“I know. I’ve tried too. Nothing,” says Deru. “But… it’s not natural. It can’t be. It happened so fast, and he’s not *that* old, and I just—” She turns away, her voice breaking. “I miss my dad.”

“I’m sorry,” says Harlan. He stands there awkwardly while she collects herself, wiping her eyes. “I didn’t mean to upset you. I just wanted to ask about his relationship with Minister Kandir. It seemed to me that Kandir might have an undue influence over your father.”

Deru sighs again. “Can we talk about this later?”

“Of course,” says Harlan quickly. “I’m sorry. I should have waited to bring it up.”

After the service, Deru seems back in good spirits. She spends awhile talking to parishioners in the courtyard while Harlan stands aside, listening. She has a rapport with each of them—no affectations, just a warm demeanor and a genuine desire to spread the good news of Kord. Only one young man in the group seems to be trying to cause a stir. 

“Open your eyes, sheeple,” he mutters, to no one in particular. “Kord is a joke.”

“What makes you say that?” says Deru, sounding honestly curious. “Kord has shown great power, and great mercy, to me and to others in our temple.”

“The twelve Supreme Entities gather around a table and laugh at how they have divided the world up into dark and light,” he says. It rings a bell in Harlan’s memory.

“Hey,” he says to the young man. “I’ve heard that line before. Are you a follower of the Messenger, by any chance?”

The young man clams up, shoving his hands in his pockets and kicking some gravel.

“I’m just wondering why you chose to attend a service at the Temple of Winds if you feel this way about Kord,” Harlan prods.

“Boccob tricks them all by withholding his true powers, and they allow it,” the boy continues. A lock of his dark hair falls over his face. He takes a deep, shaky breath. “Kord and Gruumsh are as close as lightning and thunder.”

This prompts gasps and murmurs from the crowd in the courtyard. 

“If you knew anything about the gods, you would not speak so foolishly,” says Harlan, sounding angrier than he intended. “Gruumsh aims to sow destruction and discord. Kord is virtuous and fair. There are *worlds* of difference between Kord and Gruumsh.”

“Why then do the ‘good’ gods tolerate the evil ones? Why have they not eradicated evil from our world?!” says the boy. “Only because they enjoy watching us suffer!”

Before Harlan can respond, the young man turns on his heel and flees the courtyard, disappearing down the street.

Tannin hasn’t told his friends the details, but he does already have commitments for the next few weeks. It wasn’t something he’d planned to do—but after the trial, he had stayed back, waiting for the room to clear. He’d just wanted to introduce himself to the Minister of Justice and let her know what an impression she’d made on him.

“Minister Mirama,” he had said. “The name’s Tannin McBitters. I’m a bit of a justice-seeker myself.”

“Very nice to meet you, Mr. McBitters,” said Mirama. Her gaze, when turned toward him, was so powerful that Tannin felt affixed to the floor. “Tell me more about your quest for justice.”

“A great wrong was done to my clan,” said Tannin, his expression darkening. “But there is no council that will hold the perpetrators responsible. No one can balance the scales except me. And it is my duty to avenge them.”

There was a silence during which Tannin feared he might have shared too much, out of whatever starstruck impulse had taken hold of him. 

“Sometimes there is no justice but action,” Mirama replied. “Always seek a merciful justice, where you can, but do not wait for permission to seek it.”

And Tannin had felt, in that moment, that she understood his pain better than anyone had before. A sudden thought had occurred to him.

“Hey,” he had said, “if you need a strong arm, especially around the water… I don’t know what else I’ll be doing while your lads rustle up a boat for us.”

The Minister had given him a smile. “I may have just the thing for someone as courageous and capable as yourself.”

And that is how Tannin agreed to be Kir Mirama’s enforcer along the Coast of Beory. 

Alone in the dark ocean, he is reminded of the time he spent in the Elemental Plane of Water. It feels like returning home. He swims out until he can barely see the haze of the Aberith shipyards behind him. “Look to the naval guard, the Legion of Seals,” Mirama had said. “They do not respond to my orders as they once did. I believe them to be corrupted by the magic smugglers.” 

The hulking shape of a barge looms ahead. Tannin dives deep and swims toward it. They’ll never see him coming.

“I’ll do what I can to restore order, Minister,” he had told her, with a grin.

“A full week of performances down, and the crowd’s taken quite a shine to you, Ms. Moonwater,” says Slurpt Gearix, the goblin owner and proprietor of the Black Unicorn, as Galadriel exits stage right down the rickety staircase to the dressing rooms. “How’s it feel?”

“Can’t complain!” Galadriel says with a shrug, wiping the sweat off her forehead with her sleeve. It hasn’t been her best work—she gets a little lazy when she senses the audience is more interested in their drinks than in her—but it’s fun enough, and a week has already flown by.

“Well,” says the goblin, “I’d like to offer you a chance to make your time here even more profitable.”

Galadriel raises an eyebrow. He continues.

“You might have noticed that many of our patrons take issue with the restrictions on the buying and selling of magical goods,” Gearix says. “I make no secret of the fact that I’m opposed to them myself. I was wondering if you might be willing to help me unite interested buyers with some items I happen to have on hand.” He drums his fingers against the wall. “For commission, of course.”

In the days that follow, Galadriel arranges several sales: a Sphere of Annihilation to a short wizard in heavy black robes; a set of Iron Bands of Bilarro to a Kenku named Squawker, whom she recognizes as the potential basilisk buyer; and, most concerningly, a Mirror of Life Trapping to a sweaty, shifty-eyed member of the Amber Guard.

The regulars begin to greet her by name, and she wonders if she ought to have used a pseudonym when she started here—it seems to be common practice among the denizens of the Black Unicorn. She hears quite a bit of chatter about the Messenger and his anti-establishment teachings, but learns nothing more about where one might find him. She also learns about “Mr. Odo,” a name usually whispered with trepidation. It sounds to Galadriel like he may be a mob boss, or some other figure of authority in the criminal underground. Either way, he is purported to be brutal when disappointed with his minions.

Galadriel pockets more gold during her first week of moving magical contraband than she has made in whole months of other gigs.

“Not bad, huh, Ms. Moonwater?” asks Slurpt Gearix as he pushes a pile of coins toward her across his desk. They have just sold a Decanter of Endless Water to an elderly drow for far more than its value. Galadriel knows this is how black markets operate, but she feels a twist of regret.

“Not bad at all,” she agrees, flashing a weak smile. She pushes the coins into her bag and starts to stand, but Gearix motions for her to remain seated. 

“Now, I have a special item that’s just come in,” he says, lowering his voice to a murmur. “I’m talking serious magic, seriously deadly. A potion. And I think I know someone who’d appreciate having it on hand. You ever seen a drow woman in here with white eyeballs? Like, I mean, the part where normally there’s a color in it, but it’s white?”

Galadriel nods. She’s noticed the drow woman in question staring intently at her gauntlet during performances—though she could be wrong, because with totally white eyeballs, it’s sort of hard to tell where she’s looking.

“Her name’s Yasaria. She’s got this sort of, uh, gang of dancers, and they kill people, you know, for money and stuff.” Gearix shrugs.

“Dancers?” 

“Yeah. Some kind of fighting style she invented where it looks like they’re dancing with you but then…” He mimes some feminine dance moves, clunkily. “Then they kill you, and you don’t know it ‘til you hit the ground and they’re off bouncing on their hands and climbing up walls and all that.”

*Climbing up walls?* thinks Galadriel. *She’s seen my act. She’s seen me do that.*

“Anyway, I thought the two of you might have some things in common,” says Gearix. “And I was hoping you’d be able to work in the topic of some extremely rare Underdark Ambrosia that is available for purchase at a price that can’t be beat. But, you know, in a subtle way.”

“Sure,” says Galadriel—though the tightness in her throat betrays her trepidation.

After that night’s performance, she spots the white-eyed drow woman sipping an ornate goblet of steaming black liquid. When she approaches, Yasaria looks up at her lazily, as if she’d been expecting the encounter hours ago.

“Hi,” says Galadriel. “I’m Galadriel. You must be—”

“Yasaria,” says Yasaria. She downs the remainder of her drink and sets the goblet on the bar. “I’ve been hoping to meet you. You have skills. I know a Daughter of Spiders when I see one.”

Galadriel feels the blood drain out of her face. She nods, too quickly.

“Yep. Yup!” Flustered, hating herself, she waves her gauntleted wrist. “Guilty.”

“You will join me and my sisters for training,” says Yasaria. It is not a question.

“Uh, okay,” says Galadriel. “I was supposed to talk to you about a potion? Um, it’s called Underdark Ambrosia?”

“Yes, I will buy it,” says Yasaria, waving an impatient hand. “Tell Slurpt he is a crook and a fool. Meet me in three hours in the drow cemetery. Bring nothing. Tell no one.”

At first, the Royal Librarian doesn’t even know what to do with the half-orc volunteer. He’s clearly a lover of books, but is he really prepared to care for a collection like this, with volumes of considerable age? Is it prudent to allow a stranger such unfettered access to the continent’s largest hub of knowledge?

It turns out the answer to both questions is a resounding “yes.” Hanamir begins by donating some real gems to the library—*The True History of Eillin* and a very nice copy of *The Idiot’s Guide to the Planes*, among others—and continues by taking exquisite care of every book that passes through his hands. 

It’s clear to Hermione, too, that Hanamir is radiantly happy to be back among the stacks. He procures books for her, as many as her heart desires, and the librarian is glad to let the two of them pursue their research at will. Once Hermione has read the Ixquichpehua material cover-to-cover, she moves on to biographical texts on the king, his family, and the councilmembers. 

“Hey,” says Hermione, without removing her nose from a book on Aberith’s recent history, as Hanamir sits down next to her for a brief break from re-shelving. “Did you know it was [Slee](/characters/slee/)’s mother, Queen Gillia VII, who started the council in the first place?”

“I did not,” says Hanamir. “That’s more recent than I thought.”

“I know,” says Hermione. “She was a real reformer, it sounds like. Had an advisor who was openly part of the Harpers. Like, the radical transparency group. And it turns out Nyanceth was a general, like Pouru, before he was the Minister of War. And—and—he wanted Deru to follow in his military footsteps instead of becoming a priestess. And there was never a Minister of the Sea originally, but the position was created for him, and some say it was a landing place for his retirement…”

“Are there any more books you’d want to look at today?” asks Hanamir. “The librarian is initiating last call a little early. Wants to close up quickly tonight.”

“Oh!” Hermione frowns. “Well, if there’s anything about Aberith’s historical involvement in international affairs, that’d be great. It might shed some light on the conflict between Kandir and Pouru. Pouru is a bit of an isolationist, while Kandir feels that the empire should expand via trade, or war if necessary—and he himself wasn’t born in Aberith, so his connections to the outside world are stronger. It’s really fascinating. Now that Pouru is in prison for alleged treason, Kandir may have much more freedom to—”

“I’ll go check,” says Hanamir, smiling. 

After the library closes, Hermione feels purposeless. 

“Want to grab a drink with me?” she asks Hanamir. “We could head back to the Half-Full Flagon. I met a very interesting fellow there last week who breeds chwingas. Maybe he’ll be back.”

“I’m afraid I have some personal business to attend to,” says Hanamir. Hermione notices, then, that Hanamir has a bandage around the knuckles of his right hand. 

“Should I even ask?”

“I’d prefer that you didn’t,” he says, giving her a cheerful wave. “See you tomorrow!”

He strides off in the direction of the Kiln.

---

Some nights, Tannin wonders if he might be too good at this “extralegal bounty hunter” thing. He does prefer a bit more of a challenge than these small-time pirates can offer him. Still, he can’t deny it’s an ego boost to hear that he’s known around the Bay of Beory as the Murderous Mer-Dwarf, even if it’s not quite reflective of the truth. At Mirama’s request, he hasn’t actually killed anyone yet. 

That’s the other thing that keeps him going: there’s something addictive about earning her approval. 

“Intercepted a shipment of enchanted objects tonight, boss,” he reports, standing in her office at sunrise. She sips a cup of fragrant tea while sifting through the scrolls that sit piled on her desk. “Nothing dangerous or even very rare. Just your garden-variety tokens for healing, clairvoyance, strength… but there was a whole barge full of the stuff.”

“Very good,” she says to her teacup, then looks up at him. “Any casualties?”

“No, ma’am,” says Tannin. “As little bloodshed as possible, as always. I promise.”

She stares him down, and his lips can’t help but twist into a smile. He may have knocked some heads a little harder than necessary last night, but she doesn’t need to know that. No deaths!

“My guards paint a very different picture of the Murderous Mer-Dwarf of Beory,” she says, lowering her gaze and taking another sip of tea. “Be careful not to get carried away in your zeal for restoring law and order, Mr. McBitters.”

*Restoring law and order?* He knows she says that just to tease him. As if he could ever be zealous about the law! He’s zealous for justice, the law be damned! He’s zealous for… well, for her! He chews on his lip for a moment, sensing that it’s a test of his deference. After another half a minute of silence, she smiles warmly.

“I do appreciate your work, you know,” she says. And instead of sending him on his way, per their usual routine, she rummages in a desk drawer for a hefty satchel with multiple complicated locks on its front. “So much so, in fact, that I dread the hour of your departure for the Ruins. I want to offer you this as an extra token of my gratitude, in the hopes that you will have a greater chance of returning to Aberith through its use.”

She heaves it up onto the surface of the desk and motions for him to collect it.

“What is it?” Tannin asks.

“A thousand gold pieces,” she says, with no change in her expression. 

“Whoa!” says Tannin. That could almost buy two more hands for Harlan, if he wanted to have four hands. Or two of that fancy knife set from the marketplace. Or… probably something more useful. He’d ask Hanamir. “Thank you, Minister Mirama. I don’t know what to say.”

“Use it well,” says Mirama. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”

Harlan meets Galadriel outside the Black Unicorn around noon on a Tuesday. She squints her eyes at the daylight as she cracks open the side door and emerges from the subterranean staircase, her clothes reeking of pipe smoke and pungent goblin cuisine.

“Nice makeup,” says Harlan. “You look like a raccoon.”

“It’s the style in there,” she scowls at him. “Try being even a little bit cool for once.”

“No,” says Harlan. “All right, shall we head out? Do you have your travel pass from King Slee?”

Galadriel waves the wax-sealed parchment at him and sighs theatrically. 

“Merciful Kord, your breath. Thankfully, we’re headed for open country air.”

They reach Elris’s farm by mid-afternoon. Galadriel clings to Harlan’s arm as the giant blue rancher goes to retrieve their respective animal companions. 

“I hope he’s all right,” she murmurs. “I hope he hasn’t been too lonely out here. I’ve missed him so much.”

“I’m sure he’s fine,” says Harlan. “He’s had Zotz to keep him company. And I trust Elris has taken good care of him.”

When [Buddy](/characters/buddy/) appears in her line of sight, Galadriel dissolves into joyful tears, her heavy eyeliner streaking down her cheeks. She spends the next twenty minutes covering the little pig’s fuzzy head with kisses. Camazotz, on the other hand, is less willing to accept affection from Harlan. 

“He’s a mighty fine bat, as I said,” drawls Elris. “But a wild one. I’ve had a bit of luck using some giant moths as rewards for him when he behaves.”

Harlan holds out a hand to his erstwhile steed, but Zotz only screeches and snaps.

“Now, if you like, I could put him through some more serious training, but you’d have to leave him here a few more weeks,” says Elris.

“I’d be interested in that,” says Harlan. “How much would it cost me?”

“A hundred and fifty gold, I reckon,” says Elris. 

“And you’d trust me to pay when I come back?” asks Harlan. “I don’t have the gold on me up front.”

“Well, by my thinking, if you don’t come back, I’m down a few weeks in effort, but I’m up one trained, giant bat,” says Elris, with a chuckle. “Deal?”

“Deal,” says Harlan, shaking his hand.

Under the shade of a nearby apple tree, Galadriel and Buddy have resumed full cuddle mode.

*Please tell me you haven’t been miserable out here,* Galadriel thinks. *You must be so bored.*

NAH, I’VE BEEN GOOD. ELRIS REALLY IS A NICE GUY. ZOTZ AND I DON’T HAVE A LOT IN COMMON, BUT I’VE KEPT MYSELF BUSY MAKING PUZZLES FOR HIM.

*Puzzles?*

YEAH. ELRIS GIVES HIM THESE GIANT DEAD BUGS AS TREATS. SOMETIMES I STEAL A FEW FROM HIS SHED AND HIDE THEM AROUND THE FARM, AND THEN GIVE HIM CLUES SO HE CAN FIND THEM. HE’S SMART.

Galadriel laughs. 

*And no one has figured out what you really are, right? You’re safe?*

SAFE AS CAN BE. 

She kisses the top of his head. He oinks contentedly.

*Good. Now, I have something to tell you, or… ask you, really.*

IS IT ABOUT... THE NORTHERN RUINS?

*Yes! How did you—?*

I CAN READ YOUR THOUGHTS EVEN WHEN THEY AREN’T DIRECTED AT ME.

*Hey!*

I’M SORRY. IT’S HOW I KNEW I COULD TRUST YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE.

*So you know about the legendary thing, the… quiznos? And about Magick wanting to use it to wipe out dragonkind?*

I PICKED UP THE GIST OF IT. AND YOU WANT TO KNOW IF I’LL COME WITH YOU?

*Yes. I know it’s a lot to ask, considering what you’d be risking if she found out about you…*

SURE, I’LL COME.

*Really?!*

YEAH. AFTER ALL WE’VE BEEN THROUGH? C’MON, GIVE ME A LITTLE CREDIT. I’M WITH YOU, GALADRIEL.

Hanamir darts between punches like a mosquito avoiding a baby’s swats. 

“You can be quicker than that,” he chides his student. “Channel your anger!”

The young half-orc roars and wallops the air where Hanamir’s face was a split second ago. Hanamir grabs his wrist and twists it behind his back, swiftly disabling him.

“Remember to stay present,” says Hanamir, releasing him. “The Way of the Open Hand teaches us that there is no past, no future. Only now. There is only the energy that animates all things, and there is power in directing its flow through you.”

The group of teenaged half-orcs stare at him, unified in rapture. They’ve never met anyone like Hanamir. A half-orc who carries a book under his arm? Who moves like a shadow? Who speaks as softly as a songbird at midnight, and fights as doggedly as the winter’s chill?

“Join me in meditation, friends,” says Hanamir, settling into a modified White Crane pose. “Match your breathing with the movements of your arms. Feel your own gentle spirit rise and fall, and your strength ebb and flow.”

When it is time for the youths to leave this unfinished basement in one of the Kiln’s most dangerous slums, several linger by the stairs.

“Mr. Hanamir?” one of them asks. “Last week, you said you’re just visiting Aberith… how long did you mean?”

“Only a short while longer, I’m afraid,” says Hanamir. “My friends and I must depart in another week or two.”

The stragglers are visibly crushed. Hanamir feels his heart ache for them.

“I hope you will continue your practice in my absence,” he continues. “The Way of the Open Hand teaches discipline, and can give you great peace in return. And with that peace, you might find that you can do much more in this world than you thought you could.”

He leads them up the stairs and back out into the night.

---

The night before their ship to the Northern Ruins is scheduled to set sail, the adventurers gather for a pint at the Half-Full Flagon.

“To the unknown!” says Harlan, raising his glass. “And to a dangerous and potentially misguided quest!”

The other four clink their glasses against his.

“To the awesome stuff we bought from Sanford and Son today,” adds Tannin, spinning his new Ring of Protection on his middle finger. “And to Kir Mirama for bankrolling it!”

“I still can’t believe you all went shopping without me,” mutters Galadriel.

“Somebody was too busy dance-fighting with the other spider girls,” says Harlan. “Priorities are priorities.”

“I could *tickle* you and you would *die*.”

“Now, now, you two,” says Hermione. “We should talk about our plan for when we reach the ruins. Should one of us be on Magick duty? We don’t want her to run around unattended, right?”

“We’ll use the Dimensional Shackles,” says Hanamir. No one mentions his bruised and busted lip, out of politeness (but he’d probably explain that a teenage half-orc monk trainee got a lucky hit, if asked).

“Yes, but I’d like her to have a bit more supervision, you know, moment to moment,” says Hermione. The group is silent and avoids eye contact. “Really?! Come on.”

“Sounds like you’re saying you want to supervise Magick,” says Tannin.

“Fine!” says Hermione. “If I have to be the adult here, I’ll do it. But don’t make the mistake of thinking you don’t owe me one.”

The others mumble excuses incoherently or take swigs from their drinks. After a nebulous silence, Tannin speaks up.

“Do you think it’s real? The thing?” he asks, looking around the table. “The… quiznos?”

“That’s not what it’s called,” says Hermione. “It’s the quitzananon—the quetzanyananaya—the quinceñeara—”

“We’re calling it the quiznos,” says Harlan, with a wave of his hands. “And… yes. I do think it’s real.”

“To the quiznos!” says Hanamir. “May we find it. And may it find us in good health.”

They clink glasses again and drink deeply.
