Like a sunrise, the trial chamber grows lighter, until the adventurers realize there are, in fact, no walls surrounding them. The illusion of the confining space fades into nothing. They stand in the field once more, facing the spirit of the dwarven king, but something about the scene is different. To the north, where the broad and snow-peaked mountains should be, there are only dark, jagged cliffs piercing a gloomy sky. 

“And so you find yourselves in the Shadows,” says the king.

“Did we win?” asks [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) again.

“He means, did we pass the trial?” says [Harlan](/characters/harlan/).

The king regards the adventurers with an underwhelmed squint of his eyes.

“You did well enough,” he admits. “Enough that you can be trusted with one of the positions as guardian. But now you must choose the person among you who will take that position officially.”

“How do you suggest we choose?” asks [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/).

“The powers that we grant to a guardian allow them to protect the city,” says the king, “but they are also mortally bound to its fate. Failure to protect the city, then, would be fatal.”

“What kind of powers?” says [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/), flexing her gauntleted hand.

“A guardian may travel freely to the city, no matter its location,” says the king. “Or to the places where the city would rest, should it wander to that plane.”

“Sweet deal,” says [Chunk](/characters/chunk/).

“I… think we have our volunteer?” says Harlan. 

“Yeah, I’ll do it,” says Chunk. 

“Oh!” says the king, regarding the young druid with some surprise. “Very well.”

“This is a dwarf city, right?” says Tannin. “Like, it’s all dwarves?”

“We do not discriminate,” says the king, with a shrug. “So you’re certain, then? You, large blue creature, will be a guardian of the Wandering City?”

“Well,” says Chunk, scratching one tufty sideburn, “does anyone else wanna do it?”

“If the guardian we saw had any kind of special powers, I was not impressed,” says Tannin. “It’s a no for me, thanks.”

The king says nothing. Everyone else sort of stares at the ground, pretending to be deep in thought.

“Do we *have* to take one of these guardian positions?” says Chunk.

“Um,” says the king, looking flustered. “no, I guess not.”

“So, sell us on this,” says Galadriel. “Why should any of us want to have our fates tied up with this city?”

“You all approached *me*!” says the king. “Do you realize how difficult it is to conjure these trials up for you? For all *five* of you? And to make that last one so—so personally devastating? You all nearly just lost your lives for this!”

“Yeah, I’ll do it,” says Chunk, shrugging. “Reckon I might as well do something important with my life.”

“Well… well, *good*,” says the king, the faint translucent redness fading from his cheeks. “So, do you want a ring or a bracelet?”

“Hm,” says Chunk. “Which one looks cooler?”

“Yeah, is it strictly cosmetic?” says Harlan.

“Yes, they both have the same power,” says the king. “Both simple. Both engraved with a triangle; it’s sort of our brand. Three sides... you get it.”

“Sure,” says Chunk. “I’ll go with the ring.” He turns to the party. “What do you think, right or left hand? Which finger?” He turns back to the king. “Am I able to take it off?”

“You may wear it on any finger, and it will fit,” says the king. “But once you put it on, you may find yourself unable to remove it.”

He hands Chunk a simple metal ring, engraved with an equilaterial triangle, as described. Chunk slips it onto his left index finger.

“Cool,” says Chunk.

“Very good,” says the king. “You may travel between planes once per day, and you may take up to seven creatures with you, so long as you are touching them.”

“Nice,” says Chunk.

“Why can’t Borgrear do that?” Hanamir murmurs. “He’s a guardian, and he longs to return to the city.”

“We could ask him,” says Chunk. “I just turned into a planar shuttle bus.”

“Yes, and I believe we could all use a long rest after that last fight,” says Hanamir. He chews on his lip. “Now, what happens to the houses? Does Chunk get one of the guardian houses from the material plane?”

“This is not an official part of the guardianship,” says the king. “You may do what you wish. Individual guardians built those houses; that was their choice. I believe most of them are unoccupied at the moment.”

“Ooh,” says Galadriel. “Do we get more property out of this? Can we expand our empire?”

“Hold on, ghost king,” says Tannin, holding up a hand. “What’s your jurisdiction here, if you don’t care about the houses? Who are you to run these trials?”

“I was the first ruler of the Wandering City,” says the king.

“Ohhh, so it was *you* who dropped the coin,” says Tannin. 

“Ha!” says Galadriel. “Good going!”

“Butterfingers,” snickers Harlan. Galadriel high fives him. The king makes a face.

“What is your name, sire?” asks Hanamir politely.

“King Butterfingers?” Chunk grins.

“His Majesty, King Butterfingers,” Harlan corrects him.

“My name is Hiru,” says the king. He closes his eyes and sighs, continuing. “King Hiru the Slippery.”

The adventurers need a few moments to collect themselves. Galadriel falls dramatically to the ground, cackling. Even Hanamir cracks a smile.

“So you’re cursed to recruit guardians?” says Tannin, wiping his eyes.

“I am not cursed!” says Hiru. “This is a choice!”


“You do this for fun?” says Galadriel.

“I must protect the city,” says Hiru.

“Real question: have you had any other applicants lately?” says Galadriel. She glances sideways at the rest of the party. “Any applicants wearing… strange makeup?”

“No,” says Hiru. “You all are the first in quite a while.”

“Good!” says Galadriel. “We’re ahead of the clowns.”

“Ehh, but we do know that they’re able to planeshift, at least indirectly,” says Harlan. “They may not have even tried to pass the trials.”

“Hey, will I know when I gotta come back and defend the city?” says Chunk. “Will the ring tell me it’s in danger?”

“No, the ring possesses no such power to communicate that,” says Hiru. “If you set out from one of the city’s sacred homes, you must find a way to keep in contact with it.”

“Hmm,” says Chunk.

“Don’t worry, we’ll figure that one out later,” says Galadriel.

“Are you able to visit the city yourself, sire?” asks Hanamir. 

“I can,” says Hiru, “but… I don’t go often. It’s a little weird.”

“Because they’re mad at you? For being so slippery?” says Tannin.

The king’s bluish coloring again turns pink.

“It’s just weird to go back,” he repeats.

“What do you do with all your free time, then, if there are no applicants?”

“There isn’t really time anymore where I am, so it’s mostly just this,” says the king. “I do like a game of Fantasy Scrabble every now and then, though, if anyone’s interested…”

Hanamir perks up. 

“You don’t want to go up against this guy,” Galadriel shakes her head. “He’s unbeatable.”

“One last question,” says Tannin, ignoring all this. “Are we in the Shadowfell right now? Like, the real one?” 

“Yes,” says Hiru.

“And the city’s not here,” says Tannin.

“Correct,” says the king.

“So… it must be in the Feywild?” says Tannin.

“The city is in the Feywild, yes,” says Hiru.

“Swell,” says Chunk. He holds out both his hands. “Let’s go. Everybody hop on.”

“Wait, we’re going back to the material plane first, remember?” says Harlan. “To talk to Borgrear and get some rest?”

“Oh yeah,” says Chunk. He rubs his head. “I mighta been knocked out a couple too many times back there.”

“Do you remember that you just made an eternally binding contract?” Harlan says, concerned.

Chunk nods, but looks confused. Meanwhile, Hanamir takes a leaf from the sack he filled during the Feywild trial. He places it on the ground gently. As soon as it touches the dark soil, it begins to petrify, and soon crumbles into a fine ash. Hanamir’s eyes widen, and he pats the sack of leaves as if reassuring it that he’s finished experimenting.

“Before we go, do we have any more questions for King Hiru?” says Harlan.

“Do you know why the city hasn’t moved from the Feywild in so long?” says Galadriel.

“No, I don’t,” says Hiru. “But travel between planes is often dangerous for the city’s residents, so its leaders try to minimize it. But sometimes it is necessary in order to escape threats.”

“And can our friend Chunk here get in touch with you, should he have more questions later?” asks Hanamir. “We thank you for this onboarding session, but it does seem quite brief for a lifetime occupation.”

“Yes,” says Hiru. “You know where to find me.”

With that, the adventurers link arms, and Chunk—though loopy, and perhaps concussed—plane-shifts them back to the snowy field on the material plane.

---

Borgrear’s stooped frame can be seen puttering along the field’s edge. He appears to be picking up rocks and collecting them in a sack that he drags behind him, forming a meandering trail through the snow.

“Hey, Borgrear!” says Tannin. “We’ve got big news.” He turns to Chunk. “Go on, tell him.”

“What?” says Chunk, blinking.

“You know, your soul-bound lifetime commitment that you just made,” says Tannin. “You’re a guardian now. Remember? You two are basically brothers.”

“A guardian?” says Borgrear. He lets the sack of rocks fall at his feet. His expression is difficult to read at this distance. “Which of the residences do you plan to take up?”

“I haven’t decided,” says Chunk, scratching his head. “Maybe I won’t take one.”

“But…” Borgrear stammers. 

“The ghost king said it was optional,” says Tannin.

“Optional?!” says Borgrear. He stares at his hands.

“Oh yeah, that reminds me,” says Tannin, “did you go with a ring or a bracelet? And how come you were all like, ‘I miss the city so much, woe is me, I can’t wait to die,’ when you can teleport there whenever you want?”

Borgrear says nothing, and sinks to the ground next to his bag of rocks. 

“I do not understand,” he says, finally. “After my trials, I was told… I must take up residence here, and keep this ground sacred…” He stares at Tannin. “But what is this? Teleportation? Rings and bracelets?”

“Ah, jeez,” Harlan whispers. He gives sidelong glances to Hanamir and Galadriel. “He didn’t pass his trials, did he?”

“Yeah, they gave me this ring when I became a guardian,” says Chunk. He holds out his hand. “I can take you to the city with it, if you want. We’re planning on going tomorrow.”

Borgrear puts his face in his hands and begins weeping silently. 

“Aw, man! Borgrear, bud, don’t cry,” says Tannin. “We’re going to get some sleep tonight, and we’ll tell you all about it in the morning.”

As Tannin awkwardly pats the old dwarf on the head, Hanamir takes another Feywild leaf from his inventory and places it on the snowy field. As it touches the ground, a thick green rope of a vine springs up from the earth and begins pulsating and swaying. Small clusters of leaves pop out, one after the other, from its expanding stem.

“Oh!” says Hanamir. He uproots the vine, shouting a flustered apology to Borgrear for disturbing the field.

As the adventurers eke out some space in Borgrear’s filthy abode for a night’s rest, Galadriel telepathically checks in with [Buddy](/characters/buddy/).

*You all right over there?* she thinks. *I saw you get hit in the Shadowfell trial.*

YES, I’M FINE. 

Galadriel waits for him to elaborate, but he doesn’t. She feels a sudden nervousness, sensing that Buddy is deliberately holding back details from her. 

DON’T WORRY. REALLY, I’M FINE. BUT I DIDN’T LIKE BEING IN THE SHADOWFELL.

Again the voice of the dragon falls silent.

*It is pretty awful,* she agrees. *It’s lucky the city is in the Feywild right now.*

I DON’T WANT TO GO TO THE FEYWILD, EITHER.

*Oh!* Galadriel thinks. Her face feels hot. She makes herself busy setting out her bedroll. *Oh.*
. 
I WAS NERVOUS TO TELL YOU. BUT PLANE SHIFTING… IT’S NOT MY CUP OF TEA.

The little pig settles in a collapsed ottoman a couple feet from Galadriel’s bedroll. He sniffs and snorts at its faded and fraying upholstery.

*Of course, of course—whatever you need to do. I only want the best for you.*

She feels the warm creep of shame rising up the back of her neck, remembering the trials, and the horrible feeling of certainty that her continued dealings with Lolth would lead to Buddy’s death.

I KNOW YOU DO. I’M GONNA STRETCH MY WINGS UP IN THE MOUNTAINS FOR AWHILE, I THINK. 

*Nice*, Galadriel thinks. *That’ll be really nice.* She frowns, wondering if her thoughts sound sarcastic. *I mean it!* Somehow, that last bit makes it worse.

I’LL PROBABLY BE GONE BY THE TIME YOU WAKE UP. GOOD LUCK OUT THERE, GALADRIEL.

*Thanks. I… I mean, good luck to you too. And goodnight.*

She wraps herself tightly in her blanket and pretends to fall asleep.

When the foyer is silent save for the crackle of the trash fire embers and the breathing of slumbering adventurers, Harlan rises from his bedroll and tiptoes out into the clear, cold night.

It’s not like him to be shy about seeking communion with the Lord of Storms, but the Shadowfell trial has him rattled. Could something really have happened to [Kord](/characters/kord/)? Usually, he’d say “of course not,” and sleep soundly, trusting in the divine might of the Tempest. But after the trial, and after what Yurgoz the fox man said about gods being destroyed…. 

Harlan stomps through the snow, shaking his head. It must have been some kind of mind trick—some kind of illusion meant to get him worried. An annoyingly effective one. 

There’s a mountain shrine not far from the Snowmantle Estate, and Harlan sits cross-legged on a mossy stone beneath its eaves to meditate. In moments, he feels the connection to his god, like a faint electric shock. The hair on his arms stands on end.

“I am relieved to feel your presence, my lord,” says Harlan. “I was afraid for you. I had a vision…”

“Of my death,” says Kord. “I know.” 

There is a low rumble of thunder in the dark sky. 

“Well, I just wanted to check on you,” says Harlan. “And make sure you were okay.”

“That’s very nice,” says Kord. “Not enough devotees commune with me just to see how I’m doing.” He laughs, and the thunder rumbles again. “As you’re aware, the possibility of my death is not so outlandish as I might once have thought it to be. Tritherion, god of war, was slain. A thing not thought possible.”

Harlan feels his throat tighten. It unsettles him to hear Kord talking like this. He’d hoped for reassurance, not confirmation of the worst.

“How do I protect your interests on the material plane, my lord?” he asks.

“The true form of the perpetrators is not yet known,” says Kord. “There are mercenaries working on behalf of a power I do not understand. A power greater than Tritherion, clearly. He was manipulated into making himself vulnerable. That is all I know.”

“Vulnerable in what way?”

“He was forced to intervene in a battle,” says Kord. “On the elemental plane of fire. But the battle was a ruse. Once he had appeared in mortal form, he was slain.”

“But…” Harlan stammers. He thinks of Lolth. “Is it even possible to deceive a god? To trick a god?”

“Apparently,” says Kord. 

Harlan feels another slight buzz of electricity, a little more uncomfortable this time. Kord seems agitated.

“Well, my companions and I are in the process of trying to track down the operatives from the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna,” he says. “And we seek an artifact known as the three-sided coin. Our path leads us to the Feywild tomorrow.”

“Ah, the Feywild!” says Kord, lightening up a bit. “I spent some time there as a boy. Yes, I was once a boy; that’s how this works. Shhh.” The distant thunder cracks. “Can be a dangerous place, but I think you’ll enjoy it. You have some chaos in your heart, Harlan Stormborne.”

“I hope so,” says Harlan. He fidgets. “Well, don’t get yourself trapped on my account while I’m gone.”

“Wasn’t gonna,” says Kord. “But thanks. Be careful yourself out there.”
