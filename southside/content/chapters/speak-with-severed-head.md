We learn this Dragonborn’s name is [Krankaad](/characters/krankaad/). When pressed for information, he gives some more details on how he ended up in Aberith as part of [Akra](/characters/akra/)’s crew. 

Krankaad: “I had gotten myself into a bit of trouble. Got caught stealing some things. One of the elders in our tribe, Varesh, gave me the opportunity to start over somewhere new, and he was in touch with Akra. He was still loyal to her, even though she’d been cast out.”

“Krankaad, where are your friends? Where’s the rest of this digging crew?” asks [Tannin](/characters/tannin/).

“Let’s see. You killed a few of them. There are five more. They’re probably at the other house we’d been staying in, the one that didn’t burn down,” says Krankaad.

“And do you think they’ll continue digging this tunnel even though Akra’s dead?” asks [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/).

“Well, no,” says Krankaad. “We don’t have any of the details on what she was even planning. She didn’t delegate much, other than the actual digging.”

We thank Krankaad for his help and let him go after conferring and deciding that we have no more questions for him. He runs off, surprised to escape with his life, in the direction of the other Dragonborn house.

Cal reaches down and pockets Akra’s eye patch. “You never know,” he says.

[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/), whistling to himself, then slices off Akra’s head and stores it in the Bag of Holding. 

“We’ll want to Speak With Dead,” he explains. “But we’ll also want to high-tail it out of here before any more Dragonborn show up.”

Unable to shake the unresolved mystery of the missing ring from the burned-down Dragonborn house, Cal returns to the ashes of his arson. He digd through the rubble again, and does not find a ring—but he does find a strange pendant in the shape of a demon’s head, along with a spell scroll. He takes both back with him for [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) to identify.

Meanwhile, the rest of the group takes Akra’s severed head out of the Bag of Holding upon arriving back at the Black Unicorn, and we arrange it artfully in front of the fireplace of our penthouse suite. Her eyes are facing the flames, such that we hope she’ll assume she’s in Dragonborn Hell when she is revived.

Once Harlan casts Speak With Dead, Akra’s head jolts to life. She says nothing. She stares at the fire.

“Akra… you have been summoned back,” says Harlan, standing behind her and speaking Draconic in the godliest voice he can muster. “Your mission here is not yet finished. We are trying to revive you or at the very least carry out your mission. But to do that, we need to know everything. Tell us. Who were you working with?”

“Who?” says Akra, confused. “He only gave me the name [Deladriel](/characters/deladriel/).”

“And what was this person’s goal?”

“To… to right the wrongs, to restore the true power to its rightful place…”

“Please, uh, describe the true power,” says Harlan.

“Is it not—is this not who I am speaking to? The one true creator? The true God? The one that the impostors—the children overthrew?”

“Yes,” stammers Harlan. “This is he. That was a test to prove you are truly loyal. Now you must name me.”

“But we are taught that we must never speak your name,” says Akra.

“Ah, but this ritual is the only time you may,” says Harlan. “For it is the union of our souls.”

“Your name has never been spoken to my ears,” says Akra.

“So you do not know for whom you carry out all your deeds?” says Harlan.

“For… you?” says Akra.

“Very well,” says Harlan. “Now, how shall we instruct your followers to contact Deladriel?”

Akra seems once again thrown by the question.

“Is he not in contact with you?” Her severed head frowns deeply. “But… I suppose… he was going to return to deliver the remaining equipment that we needed to carry out the plan. They could simply wait at the tunnel for him.”

“You have done well, my child,” says Harlan. “The resurrection plans are in the works. In the meantime, be at rest.”

After a little while, Cal reappears and shows off the pendant and scroll he found. There’s definitely an uncomfortable energy emanating from it.

Harlan casts Identify on it, and there’s a lot about the pendant that’s still unclear. It controls something—but he’s not sure what. It’s not in his magical vocabulary. It’s like it controls a void, or nothingness. It does not appear to be cursed. Galadriel volunteers to take the pendant and attune to it, in the hopes that she’ll be able to understand it further after doing so.

The scroll, however, is easier for Harlan to Identify. It’s a scroll of protection that guards against Celestials. Whoever had this may have been anticipating an encounter with a Celestial. Reading the scroll will enclose you in an invisible barrier for five minutes, during which no creature of his type can come near you. It is a one-time-use scroll.

At this point, we settle in for a long rest.

The next morning, Hanamir points the Mirror of the Past at the instructions we picked up from Akra’s things. They don’t have much of a past—they were written by a figure only Cal recognizes as Lord Deladriel. They were brought by courier to Akra, and that’s all. But the confirmation that Deladriel is behind this dark plan is still something!

Galadriel tries to tune in to the static that she’d heard during her downtime, the voice that was telling her to “bring something” and that her “friend was waiting.” But she has no luck. She does, however, have attunement to the void pendant. She’s still unsure what the void is, but she thinks she’d be able to control it, and she’d know it when she saw it.

Since Deladriel is not expected back at the tunnel until later in the day, Hanamir goes to the library. He has a few things he wants to research: first, the Dragonborn pantheon, and whether or not there’s a god that is “nameless” or matching Akra’s description otherwise. He reads about Bahomet and Tiamat, but nothing jumps out at him. So Akra’s beliefs seem to be unorthodox—perhaps unorthodox enough to get her cast out of her clan for heresy. He also asks the librarian if he knows the “power” symbol from Akra’s tattoo, but he does not recognize it.

During this time, at Tannin’s suggestion, a few of us join him in helping to rebuild the Half-Full Flagon. We also take some of the healing potions from the bag of holding in preparation for our ambush plan, and we end with Harlan planning a shopping trip to [Sanford](/characters/sanford/) & Son using his magical Ring of Sanford & Son Location.
