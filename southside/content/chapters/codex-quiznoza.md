The sky is marbled with clouds the color of smoke. Above the ship, a lone seagull grows tired of circling the mast. It lands on the deck near Magic and [Hermione](/characters/hermione/).

“Look at that!” says Magic. “What is that thing?!”

“It’s a seagull,” says Hermione. The bird blinks at them, then lets out a short burst of mournful cries. “Seagulls live by the water and like to steal your food.”

“Steal my food?” Her cloak balloons with ocean air as she bends down to look at the bird. “Maybe I’ll erase them from existence, too! Hahahahaha! Dragons and seagulls! Hahaha!”

Hermione gives her a strained smile.

[Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) and Buddy, sitting nearby, catch this last exchange over the roar of the ocean.

*You know I had to tell them, right? Not just because I’m terrible with secrets, I mean. After all their suspicions, I owed them the truth.*

OH, YEAH, I KNOW, says Buddy. HEY, DON’T STRESS. I KIND OF APPRECIATE THAT EVERYONE KNOWS NOW. I CAN BEHAVE A LITTLE MORE LIKE MYSELF. WALK ON MY OWN FOUR LEGS, AND ALL THAT.

*But we still have to keep it a secret from Magic, or she’ll try to kill you on the spot.*

HONESTLY? I AM NOT THAT WORRIED ABOUT HER.

They glance over at the tiefling, who is now flattened against the ship’s railing, cowering in terror at the seagull taking confident steps in her direction.

*Fair enough*, thinks Galadriel. *Just be careful. She can be unpredictable.*

They watch as the expression on Magic’s face changes abruptly from fear to ecstatic joy.

“I see it!” she says, grabbing Hermione by the arm. “I can see the towers!”

[Harlan](/characters/harlan/), [Tannin](/characters/tannin/), and [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) look up from their contentious game of Drephis Hold’em. The horizon ahead is indeed marked by several tall smudges, which they suppose must be the aforementioned towers. It’ll be awhile before it starts to look exciting, they realize, and turn back to their game.

But Magic’s excitement soon turns from cute to creepy. The Amber Guardsmen who are crewing the ship watch her nervously.

“I’ve been waiting so long,” she croons, leaning over the bow of the ship. “I need it, I need it, it’s fate, it’s mine…”

The card game fizzles out when Hanamir wins everything in the (strictly theoretical) pot, including Tannin’s trident and Harlan’s giant bat. 

“Aha!” says Hanamir placidly. “And that’s how they do it back at Drephis State, my friends.”

“Well played,” concedes Harlan. “Should we get ready to go?”

Hanamir raises his eyebrows at the group of four Amber Guardsmen who have gathered around the mainsail to whisper conspiratorially.

“Yes,” he says. “Looks like they can’t wait to be rid of us.”

The adventurers pile into a rowboat. The Amber Guardsmen lower them down into the iron-dark sea, and almost immediately adjust the ship’s sails to turn back.

“Wait! When are you coming back for us?” Harlan shouts.

“Four days!” calls one of the Amber Guard, just as the ship fades from earshot.

The beach is noisy with both crashing waves and jungle sounds: birds, insects, and the occasional unidentifiable growl. The air is heavy and humid. The sand leads directly to the base of a large stepped pyramid with lots of thick green overgrowth and walls in various stages of crumbling. 

Hermione lingers to the back of the group with Magic, much to Magic’s chagrin. 

“I don’t want her darting ahead and pushing some button that will trigger a trap and kill us all,” Hermione explains. 

“Right. We have Tannin for that,” quips Harlan. 

Sure enough, Tannin is already standing at the base of the pyramid, ankle-deep in a viscous, swampy puddle. 

“Guys?” he says. “This puddle is really, uh, aggressive.”

“Aggressive how?” asks Hanamir.

“Like, I think it’s sort of… sucking me into it…”

“Like quicksand?” says Harlan. 

“Yes! Yes, exactly like that,” says Tannin. “Good thing your boy can handle a little soggy sand.”

He casts Shape Water and directs the liquid of the quicksand away from himself, enabling his escape. But as he scrambles back to stable ground, the movement of the water tips something out of balance, and the nearest wall begins to collapse. The adventurers find that none of the ground they stand on is particularly solid after all. 

In a disorienting rush, they have all fallen down into a long, narrow vault. There’s a light yellow haze in the air. They can see more rubble, perhaps from a previous collapse, but most of the room is intact. There is a diorama of a hunting party in the center of the room, and several alcoves in the walls showing scenes from tribal life: fishing, weaving, worshipping at a temple. The figurines inside are free-standing, brightly-painted clay. 

Harlan looks closer at the temple scene.There’s a figure representing a god standing there wearing a feathered garment, and he is surrounded by people offering up bowls. There is a large snail that is painted to look afraid. 

“Looks like a sacrifice,” he says. “Maybe the poor snail is the offering.”

He casts Detect Magic. The figurines all emit the telltale golden glow of transmutation magic.

“These things are all transmuted, so be careful,” he says. “Except for their weapons, actually. Their weapons seem to be just little dolls’ accessories.” Harlan looks closer at a clay figure holding a shepherd’s crook. It is painted distinctively, but it does not glow.

“Transmuted, huh?” says Tannin, picking up a warrior from the center of the room and tossing it in his hand. “Transmuted from what?”

He misses catching it on the next flip, and the clay warrior shatters on the floor. 

“Whoops,” he says. A full-size human warrior materializes, holding a spear and wearing an animal skull headdress. He moves his mouth as if he’s speaking, but no one can hear a sound. 

The warrior stabs the air with his spear, making Tannin jump out of the way. 

“Sorry all,” says Tannin. “I’ll fix this!” He tosses his net over the warrior. The warrior thrashes.

With a heavy sigh, Harlan swings his hammer at the warrior. He bursts into dusty clay shards that settle noisily on the ground.

“Okay, no more touching the dioramas!” says Harlan. 

At that, Tannin pulls the shepherd’s crook free from its figurine’s hand. 

“What did I just say?!” sighs Harlan. But this time, nothing happens. Tannin smirks.

Meanwhile, Hanamir inspects the rubble. 

“I don’t think there’s much likelihood of us getting out of here the way we came,” he concludes. “If we move any of this, it’s likely to set off another collapse. The only way out now is through.”

Magic sulks.

“I could help you, you know,” she whines. “If you would only take off my shackles…”

“Not a chance, sweetie, I’m sorry,” says Hermione. “All right, shall we check out the door, then? Is it locked?”

The door at the end of the room is made of smooth white stone. There is no visible lock mechanism, but when Hanamir leans on it, it doesn’t budge. There is, however, a little notch above the door that could potentially be a keyhole. 

“I’ll check it out,” says Galadriel. She gingerly tests whether the wall will accommodate her weight without collapsing again, and then climbs to inspect the notch. “Toss me that shepherd’s crook thing,” she says. Tannin does so.

Sure enough, the shepherd’s crook fits inside the notch and the white stone doors spring open to a long, dark hallway whose walls are carved to look like bamboo.

“First room down,” says Hanamir. “All right, team. Let’s get in formation.”

The adventurers follow him. The hallway gets darker and darker until everyone is using their darkvision except Harlan, who doesn’t have that. Instead, he lights up his Kord medallion, casting an eerie glow on the bamboo-carved walls. 

Hanamir taps along the floors with a ten-foot pole. But the force of the pole isn’t enough to trigger a trap that only clicks into place when he, Tannin, and Galadriel have all stepped onto the same piece of flag stone. At that moment, two logs swing out from within the bamboo walls, knocking Hanamir to his stomach on the cold, slightly damp floor. 

It’s a rare moment of discombobulation for the usually nimble monk, but he quickly rights himself and approaches the set of tall bronze doors carved with a seaweed texture that stand ahead of him. Pressing his ear to the door, he can hear a faint tapping from the other side. 

“Something is in there,” he whispers. “Something alive.”

He tests the door handle. It’s not locked. He silently pushes it open. The floor is wet and muddy. Galadriel holds out a hand to the walls—they are similarly slimy. 

The adventurers can see a massive boulder in the center of the room. Next to it rests a long bamboo staff. Nearby, and the apparent source of the tapping, a large crayfish scuttles in the mud. 

“I’m going in,” whispers Galadriel. She slides a little as she vaults up the wall, but is able to hang on despite the slime. 

The adventurers watch as she spider-crawls up to the center of the ceiling, directly overhead of the boulder and the staff. Once there, she casts Mage Hand and a faintly glimmering copy of her own hand descends slowly until it reaches the staff. It grabs hold.

With a twitch and a shudder, the staff springs to life. It’s not a staff—it is, in fact, the leg of a giant hermit crab. The boulder turns, revealing a spiral-patterned shell.

“Dang!” says Tannin. He and the other adventurers jump backward into the bamboo hallway and slam the seaweed door shut.

“What about Galadriel?” hisses Hermione. 

“She’s on the ceiling, she’s fine,” whispers Hanamir. “For now,” he amends.

“So what’s our plan?” says Harlan. “Do we try to communicate, or go straight to force?”

“Unshackle me!” says Magic, breathlessly, unaware that she’s being ignored. “Let me in there! I’ll destroy them instantly and save the music girl!”

“I can cast Speak with Animals,” says Tannin. “But it’s a ritual... and it’ll take ten minutes.”

“Get started, then!” says Harlan. 

Tannin procures a tightly bundled bunch of herbs and a flint stick from his backpack. He attempts to light a flame.

“Whoops,” he says, getting some smoke. “Just a sec.”

“I think it’s speaking in a human voice,” says Hanamir, his ear to the door again. “Will Speak with Animals still work?”

“It should,” says Hermione. “It must be speaking Olmen! That’s the ancient tongue of the Ixquichpehua—I read all about it—and that crab, that must be one of the gods they worshipped—”

“Like, that right there is the actual god, or—?” says Tannin, looking up from his materials.

“Do the ritual!” says Harlan. He opens the door a crack and tries miming the phrase “wait just a few minutes, please” at the giant angry crab, to no avail. 

When the ritual is finally complete after a brutally slow ten minutes, the adventurers open the door again to see Galadriel crouched in the far corner of the ceiling, very much like an actual spider, using her still-glowing Mage Hand to slap the crab’s claw cheekily each time it makes a futile grasp at the air beneath her.

“Have you eaten my friend yet?” says Tannin, his voice ringing out confidently in a language no one else understands. The crab stops pinching at the air and turns its stalked eyeballs toward him. 

“Who is this?” the crab’s voice booms back at him. “Who dares enter the Temple of the Guardian? Be off with you! Before I lose my temper!”

“Cool, cool,” says Tannin, mostly to himself. “Uh, we’d love to get out of here, sir. Can you direct us to the exit?”

“Begone whence you came!” 

“We tried that, but there’s a cave in,” says Tannin. He raises his eyebrows and gives a tentative thumbs up to the other adventurers. “Any other ways out?”

The crab snaps its claws inscrutably at its crayfish companion. They confer for a moment.

“If I let you pass, you must touch nothing in my Temple,” says the crab.

“Deal!”

The crab lowers its claws, and calls off the crayfish from its frenzied tapping against the wall beneath Galadriel. 

“Hey Tannin!” Galadriel shouts down. “Can you tell the crab I’m sorry I grabbed his leg? I thought it was a stick. Totally my bad!”

Tannin translates this to Olmen. The crab, surprisingly, looks like he’s going to be cool about it.

“Tell her if she comes down now, all is forgiven,” he says.

“He says it’s chill!” Tannin yells back. Galadriel creeps down from the ceiling slowly, rejoining the other adventurers by the door.

“Tell him thanks,” she says, appearing to really mean it. Her face is paler than usual.

“May I lay a claw on you?” the crab asks Tannin, its eye stalks looming in close. 

“Uhhhhhhh,” says Tannin, panicking. “No…” He looks around for help from his companions, but then remembers no one else can understand the crab. “...No.”

“I understand.” The crab draws its eyes back, turning its body away slightly.

“Wait,” says Tannin. “Why?”

“I thought I might try to help,” says the crab. The hostility is gone from its voice.

“Okay, sure,” says Tannin. His face has a hint of the mischievousness that his companions recognize from the moments in battle immediately preceding a Barbarian Rage. They each hold their breath. “Sure, go ahead.”

The giant crab lowers a heavy claw onto Tannin’s shoulder.

“Now you understand our language,” he says, “without the need for your silly spell.”

“Whoa,” says Tannin. It’s true: the language feels clear in his ears now, like natural speech, rather than like an echo through a seashell. “Thanks!”

“Yes,” says the crab. He lifts his claw from Tannin’s shoulder and points it toward a narrow corridor behind him. “That is the way out.”

“Like, it goes up outside the pyramid?”

“The stairs lead down, but eventually… up.”

“Okay,” says Tannin. He motions for the others to follow him. “We’ll go that way then. Thanks again.”

He gives the crab a quick wave, and then the crayfish a polite nod of his head. He leads the adventurers across the muddy floor toward the hallway. The large crustaceans watch them pass in silence. 

But the hallway only gets muddier as it slopes gently downward. The door at the end of the hallway is blocked by a good two feet of heavy, wet silt. 

“Hmm,” says Tannin. 

He splashes noisily back to the crab room. “Hey, uh, sorry to bother you again, but this door down here? It’s pretty blocked.” 

The crab clicks its claws wordlessly. 

“So…” Tannin looks around. “Is there another way out?” 

“Yes, yes, try the other hallway. On your right.”

“Both of them lead out?”

“Elsewhere, first,” says the crab. “Then out.”

Tannin gulps audibly. He turns to go, then swivels back again.

“Sorry, just one last thing. Could you give my friend from the ceiling the gift of Olmen speech too? Or instead of me, maybe? She’s more of a talker, and…”

“You have what you need,” says the crab. “Be on your way, now.”

“Okay,” says Tannin. “Oh! And, if you see us again, it’s just because we got blocked and had to turn around, not because we’re disrespecting you or your very good temple in any way. Okay. Bye!”

He plods back down the corridor, where the other adventurers wait, wide-eyed. Only Buddy seems to be enjoying the abundance of mud. 

WOW. SIMPLE DELIGHTS, GALADRIEL. GOTTA MAKE TIME FOR THE LITTLE THINGS, YOU KNOW?

He rolls onto his back and snorts a mud bubble at Magic, who frowns.

*Careful*, thinks Galadriel.

WHAT? THIS IS WHAT PIGS DO.

“All right, folks,” says Tannin. “They say there’s another hallway we could use, but if this is the one they recommended first, I think we should just do this one.”

Hanamir inspects the door’s visible hinges.

“Could be done with enough force, perhaps,” he says. “But it may be worth our while to check the other way.”

“Nah,” says Tannin. “I’m gonna just Shape Water again and get all this crap out of the way.”

Without hesitation, he sends a wave of force through the silt. Solid ground appears in the center of the hallway as the sludge parts, rising in parallel waves along each wall. Quickly, Hanamir tests the door handle. It budges. With a heave, he pulls the stubborn door open, and they hurry through it as the mud collapses back to the floor behind them.

“Nice work,” says Harlan, shaking some silt off his boots. “You’re really thriving in this leadership role, Tannin.”

“Ah, shut up,” mumbles Tannin, blushing faintly.

They look around. They are now standing on a rocky beach next to a pool of glowing water that laps gently against the dark sand. Green fronds float on its surface. The room itself is cavernous, with walls of rough stone. Directly across the pool is a set of doors carved with a sun symbol. 

“Any linguistic insight on that symbol? I assume it doesn’t have a literal Olmen meaning for anything besides the sun?” Harlan asks.

“Just a picture of the sun, I think,” says Tannin. “Oh! But… I understand the name of the quiznos now.” He looks at Magic, shiftily. “It means… 'plane-splitter.'”

“Ah,” says Harlan. “Great.”

“About that door, though,” says Hermione. “How should we do this?”

“Want me to crawl along the wall and check it out?” Galadriel asks.

“Just a second,” says Hanamir. “I don’t trust this water.” He procures his ten-foot pole and dips it into the pool.

A shape flickers under the surface of the water, and with the sound of an aquatic squeal, a young woman emerges from the center of the pool. Her golden hair and youthful face radiate light from the surface of the water, and she holds a dark blue shawl around herself. She begins singing in a language that even Tannin does not understand. Still, he’s the only one with a real shot at communicating with her. Galadriel nudges him forward.

“Ma’am?” says Tannin. “Uh, hi. Sorry to disturb your pond, ma’am… and your song, very nice singing, by the way…”

The woman stops singing and fixes him with her gaze. The adventurers notice that they can’t see the half of her body that is still beneath the pool’s surface. She responds to Tannin in Olmen.

“My name is Dasani,” says the woman. “Who are you? Why are you here?”

“We stumbled down into this dungeon, and, well, we’re trying to find our way out,” Tannin starts.

“Dungeon?” Dasani’s eyes narrow.

“Temple! I mean temple,” Tannin says quickly. “Sorry. I’m not a native speaker.”

“Oh,” says Dasani. She lowers her eyes and points to a narrow ledge along the wall. “You are free to pass through my room.”

Hermione tugs on Tannin’s sleeve.

“You have to translate, or else we can’t help you here,” she whispers. 

“Oh, right,” says Tannin. “She says we can pass. She seems pretty cool.”

“You wanna ask her anything about the rest of the pyramid?” suggests Harlan.

“Okay,” says Tannin. To the woman in the water, he says, “You know, I’m a fan of water, too. Very nice pool you got here.”

“Thank you,” says Dasani. “You’re welcome to join me for a swim, if you like. Though my pet might bug you a little.”

“Ah, thanks, I just might. And don’t worry. I’m *very* comfortable with all kinds of sea creatures,” Tannin chuckles. “Anyway, how’d you end up in here yourself?”

“Me?” she giggles, hugging her shawl tighter around her shoulders. “I’m an agent of Zotzahal, god of bats.”

“Ahh, nice! Funny story—one of my friends is a giant bat named Zotz. Probably not the same guy, though.” Tannin looks around, running out of things to say again. “So... how do you spend your time down here?”

“I help protect the treasures of this temple, for it was built to honor Zotzahal, among other holy creatures.”

“Sweet,” says Tannin. “Well, I guess we’ll be passing through now, along the ledge, like you said.” He glances at a dark shape beneath the surface, moving near the periphery of his vision. “I mean, actually… first, I want to take you up on that swim!”

He drops his backpack and dives in. Dasani disappears beneath the surface, her shape nowhere to be seen, though they can all still see Tannin, as well as something else undulating in the depths. 

Tannin points his trident at the dark shape and actually uses it for its Fish Command purpose for the first time in ages. 

“Ha!” he exclaims in Aquan. The creature is under his command. He beckons with his trident for it to come closer to the surface. A giant eel emerges, emitting a faint buzz of electricity. The hair on Harlan’s arms stands on end. Tannin transfers his consciousness to the eel and looks down at the bottom of the pool through its eyes. The floor is a beautiful crystalline cave, littered with gold and other treasures. 

But Dasani is still invisible in the water. Tannin can hear her giggling again, and this time it sounds malevolent. Something in the water next to him is bubbling unexpectedly—it’s very hot—suddenly, a boiling wave pushes him out of the pool and back onto the rocky sand.

“What gives?!” cries Galadriel. Then she thinks, *Buddy, any idea what her deal is?*

SHE’S A NARID. BUT THIS ONE SEEMS A LITTLE... OFF. NARIDS USUALLY DON’T BOIL PEOPLE.

She casts Mage Hand once more and directs the spectral appendage to plunge into the pool until it reaches the crystalline floor. It gropes around blindly for a moment, and then reemerges with a small silver idol in the shape of a bird. It drops the idol at Galadriel’s feet. 

Dasani’s voice reverberates off the cavernous walls, and she reappears in the center of the pool. Her face is a mask of rage.

“Who dares plunder my treasure?!”

The words are meaningless to Galadriel, but she gets the idea nonetheless.

“You started it!” she yells back. “We were just going to pass through peacefully, and then you boiled Tannin!”

But Dasani does not care who started it. She wrings out a section of her deep blue shawl in Galadriel’s direction, and out bursts a spray of acid. Galadriel is hit and blinded immediately, her eyes dripping blood.

“Release me!” murmurs Magic, jumping up and down on her toes. She pleads with Hermione. “Release me, and let me take care of this thing! It’d be so easy!”

“Shhh,” says Hermione, dragging her away from the gory aftermath of the boiling wave and the acid.

Harlan casts Thunderwave, knocking Dasani out of the water and onto the rocky ledge. The ceiling trembles at the thunder’s force, and dust rains down on them all. 


“Careful with that,” says Hanamir. He takes the destabilizing moment to sprint along the ledge and land a piercing blow to Dasani’s abdomen with his sword. 

Recovered enough from his scalding wounds, Tannin flies into a rage. He races across the surface of the pool—his feet never sinking more than an inch—and impales the narid in the stomach with all three spokes of his trident. It is a mortal wound, but she lives yet.

“If you spare me,” she croaks, “I’ll let you take all the treasure in this room.”

From the beach, Harlan interjects.

“Well?” he says. “What do we think about this?”

“We don’t!” snarls Galadriel, her face a horror-movie mess. “Obviously!”

“It’s worth considering,” says Harlan. “Since then we wouldn’t have to deal with the eel, and we could just pass through…”

“Ha! She said we could pass through originally, and look what happened.” Galadriel spits out some blood that has pooled in her mouth. “All right, now point me in the direction of this idiot and let me handle it.” 

Bewildered, Harlan pivots Galadriel so that she is facing Dasani. 

“Guys! Duck!” she calls out. A cloud of daggers appears in the air above her. Tannin and Hanamir jump out of the way just in time as it descends with brutal force on Dasani, ripping her to shreds.

“Nice,” says Tannin. He tosses Galadriel a piece of bread from the Satchel of Eternal Hunger. “Eat up.”

The bread bounces off her face and falls to the ground. Harlan picks it up and hands it to her.

“Thanks,” says Galadriel. She eats it ravenously and is healed before their eyes. Her expression remains murderous. 

“So, what now?” says Hermione. She nods at the shape of the eel beneath the surface of the pool. “You think we can all get across without that guy zapping us?”

“I’ll take care of it,” says Tannin with a shrug. He dives back into the water and tridents the eel, dragging it with him back to the surface. Galadriel nocks an arrow and sends it piercing through an eel eyeball straight through an eel brain. For reasons she can’t quite place, it brings back a feeling of nostalgia.

“Good work, team,” says Hanamir. He tiptoes back across the ledge to the beach and puts an ear against the door to the hallway that connects to the crab god room. “Hmm. I don’t think they liked that Thunderwave too much. Lots of agitated clicking sounds back there.”

Harlan shrugs. “How about that treasure, then?” 

Still in the water, Tannin produces his net. “Coming right up!”

He dives down to the floor of the pool and gathers everything into the net. He hauls it back out and deposits it all on the rocky beach.

“Let’s see here,” says Harlan eagerly. He picks up a small golden figure of a reptile. “These six little guys look expensive! Same with the gold mask. We should see if Sanford and Son want them.” His smile fades. “If we make it out of here, anyway.”

Galadriel inspects a silver idol that matches the one she originally stole with her Mage Hand. It is, in fact, a bottle, filled with a pungent yellow liquid and a single, floating eyeball. Over her shoulder, Hermione gasps.

“That’s a Clairvoyance potion!” she says. “I’ve seen those before. Great find.”

The only remaining item is an ordinary-looking pair of gloves. Hanamir puts them on.

“Aha!” he says. “I have the overwhelming feeling that, if a small projectile were to fly by me, I’d be able to snag it from the air easily. These must be Gloves of Missile Snare.” He turns to Harlan. “These might be of use to you on your aerial steed, Harlan.”

“Indeed!” says Harlan. Hanamir takes off the gloves and passes them to Harlan, who pockets them. “Appreciate it.”

“Onward, I guess?” says Tannin. He looks toward the door with the sun symbol carved into it. 

“Yes,” says Hanamir. “Follow me.”

And the adventurers pass, single file, along the rocky wall by the pool, past the dead narid, deeper into the dungeon.
