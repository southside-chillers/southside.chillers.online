“You guys!” [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) squeals. “Look at the waffle bars!”

The adventurers have spent the past evening at the Prismatic Inn, an upscale urban resort in Aberith’s Silver Hill neighborhood. It is now an hour after sunrise, and the party’s vibe is decidedly weird.

“‘Waffle Good,’” reads [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/), “and ‘Waffle Evil.’” He smiles softly. “That’s very clever.”

“I don’t *get* it,” [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) nearly roars. He had had to be bribed into getting into bed the night before with the (factual) promise that he’d be stronger and better-equipped to hunt clowns after getting some sleep. His attitude upon awakening is one of (energized) bitter resentment.

“Oh, it’s a pun,” says [Chunk](/characters/chunk/), helpfully. “Like, ‘Lawful Good’ and ‘Lawful Evil’? The way we describe people’s general moral alignment based on their motives and methods of achieving their goals.” He guffaws. “Now, what I wanna know is, where’s ‘Waffle Neutral’ in all this? Am I right, y’all?”

[Harlan](/characters/harlan/) and [Hermione](/characters/hermione/) have both swiftly assembled plates of pastry and fruit from the continental breakfast buffet and are eating in silence. They stare wordlessly at Galadriel, who has made a big show of rejecting the lawfulness of both waffle stations and has heaped toppings from Evil and Good on an ambitiously-sized stack of carbohydrates. She grins over at them, but they refuse to acknowledge her antics.

“Come on! Lighten up a bit, will you?” she trills.

The call to levity falls flat, however, as the somber sound of distant bells rings out. A few well-dressed humans sipping coffee in the corner put down their cups and begin murmuring and shaking their heads.

“That’ll be it, then,” one says. “That’s [Pouru](/characters/pouru/) executed.”

“I’ll never believe she was a traitor,” says another. “Something about it all just doesn’t add up.”

“Yes, and you know what else?” says a third, in a voice trembling with emotion. “Last night’s disaster only happened because our Minister of War was locked up. We’re vulnerable without her. This was a coordinated attack, mark my words.”

Still grumbling, Tannin stacks a pile of breakfast meats on his plate and finds a spot away from the others to devour it. Chunk wanders up and down the buffet, murmuring something to himself about how “Waffle Neutral” is probably just a waffle with no toppings on it. Hanamir procures a cup of tea and sits down next to Hermione and Harlan.

“So, you all will head to the Temple of [Kord](/characters/kord/) to get advice on the, um, *ursed-cay ard-bay* situation,” Hermione whispers, “and I’ll go to the library to do some research. Meet back at the Half-Full Flagon when we’re done. Plan?” 

“Plan,” says Hanamir.

When the adventurers cross the threshold of the Temple of Kord, [Deru](/characters/deru/) looks up from her altar and greets them with a wan smile. 

“Ah,” she says, and nods at Tannin. “You’re back. Problem with that new hand of yours? A backwards thumb, maybe? That does happen sometimes.”

Tannin flexes his fingers and inspects them one by one.

“Nah, I’m good,” he says. 

“Glad to hear it,” says Deru. “What brings you all to the Shrine of the Tempest today?”

“A plea for magical advice,” says Harlan. “But first, I did want to ask how you were holding up. We were very sorry to hear about your father’s condition.”

“Thank you,” says Deru. Her voice sounds thin. “I’m not optimistic. All we can do at this point is make him comfortable and ease his journey to the astral plane.”

“May Kord grant him a peaceful voyage,” says Harlan, making the Sign of the Lightning.

“Indeed.” Deru bows her head, then breathes deeply and blinks rapidly, as if returning to the surface from deep underwater. “So, what kind of magical advice can I provide for you today?”

“Actually, may I speak with you privately?” asks Harlan. 

“Of course,” says Deru, and she ushers him from the nave to a candlelit corner. Their voices diminish to whispers. 

Out of respect, the other adventurers attempt to keep their eyes downcast, with varying levels of success. Galadriel can’t help but peer at the two clerics from the corner of her eye. Are they talking about her? Seems nearly certain that they are. Are they suspicious of her motives? Probably. How dare they—it was the gauntlet! It wasn’t her fault! She doesn’t want [Cazna](/characters/cazna/) spying on them any more than they do. And Cazna has it out for *her* most of all!

And, in the back of her mind, there’s another thought, and it’s about the gauntlet, and her spider-climbing abilities, and what might happen if Harlan does succeed in removing Lolth’s curse….

In another minute or two, Deru scrawls something on a piece of parchment and hands it to Harlan. He looks at it, nods, and tucks it into his pocket. He glances at Galadriel, and she quickly looks away. But she knows he saw.

It’s a funny thing when Tannin turns out to be right. He’d been insistent, the night of the explosion, that if they let the clown get away, they’d be making a huge mistake. 

“We need to track him *now*, while the trail is fresh,” he’d argued passionately. The other adventurers, depleted of both physical and magical energy, had voted him down in favor of sleep.

But after a night’s rest and a morning’s sojourn to the Temple of Kord, their pusuit of the clown feels laughably directionless. An entire city sprawls around them, and there is nothing (save for the general reputations of various neighborhoods) to guide them in their search.

“It’s for the best, as far as I’m concerned,” says Hermione, when they meet her back at the Half-Full Flagon that night. “We’ve been sidetracked by so many unrelated foes lately, and what I want to do is get back to the primary mission: taking down the Lich.”

“It’s possible that these threats are, in fact, connected,” says Hanamir. “What threatens the city of Aberith and the continent of Ivrend is a threat to all who would live freely.”

“I suppose so,” says Hermione. “But I’m tired of pursuing every evildoer who crosses our path. I’ll spend years fighting small-time bad guys and I’ll never get my next manuscript written and published.”

“If we’re going to be a little while in Aberith, I’m going to see if I can get my gig at the Black Unicorn back,” muses Galadriel. “A couple nights a week performing in the Kiln might generate some leads, not to mention extra gold.”

“Well, I’m hoping it won’t take us *that* long to find this person,” says Harlan. “If he’s wandering around the city making meetings with top generals and arranging catastrophes while dressed as a clown, he can’t be hard to miss.”

**SIX WEEKS LATER**

It’s a fairly standard Thursday night at the Black Unicorn. Galadriel has persuaded her friends to come hang out there during her set, which is some new material she’s been working on during the last couple weeks of downtime. The lounge area surrounding the stage, adjacent to the bar, is populated by the usual clientele: goblins, drow, humans in fashionably grungy attire, half-orcs, halflings, and a smattering of more exotic creatures such as Kenku and dragonborn.

The night is still young, and Galadriel is only partway into her first act (a self-indulgent cabaret-style performance of lute, vocals, noncommittal comedic sketches, crowd banter, and gravity-defying, wall-scaling performance art) when the clown walks in.

It’s hard to say who among the party, seated together near the bar, reacts first. From Galadriel’s vantage point on stage, she’d say it was Tannin, whose face transforms from lukewarm boredom to rage-adjacent intensity in a matter of milliseconds. But from Hermione’s perspective at the table, it’s Hanamir, who rises swiftly and silently to take a better position on the opposite wall to monitor the situation.

The clown—sporting green and white face paint, rather than the red and blue of Pouru’s contact, Number Six—is flanked by two hulking individuals who appear to be his bodyguards, along with several average-sized human men. They sit down at a table close to a corner, within earshot of where Hanamir stands, watching and listening.

“Hey,” Harlan whispers to Tord, who has taken to tagging along with Harlan on their nights out. “Do you recognize any of those guys? The ones who just came in, with that clown?”

Tord cranes his neck to look at them. It’s not subtle.

“No,” says Tord. He returns his attention to his drink.

“Are we gonna go talk to that fella?” Chunk asks. He arranges his face in a manner that he hopes appears tough, but nonchalant.

“Maybe,” says Harlan. His eyes dart around the room, checking exits. There’s one behind them, but it looks like it’s only accessible to employees. He looks at Galadriel, who has begun spider-climbing toward the front entrance, passing it off as part of her performance. The crowd seems impressed by this, and begins pelting her with gold coins. 

“Ugh,” sighs Hermione. “I’ve been enjoying our streak of not getting into public brawls, if I’m being honest.”

But Tannin has evidently been waiting for this exact public brawl for several weeks. He stands up from their table and nearly kicks over his chair in his zeal to make a move. Instead of immediately confronting the clown, though, he first makes a trip to the bar, emerging minutes later with an oversized mug of ale in each hand. Then he wanders toward the clown’s table and sets the drinks down.

“Hello there,” he says, in a voice clearly meant to be casual but sounding quite aggressive. “You’re an odd-looking fellow. I like odd people. Let’s have a drink and you can tell me your story.”

The clown barely acknowledges Tannin’s presence. One of the massive bodyguards positions himself between Tannin and the clown.

“What do you think you’re doing, little man?” the bodyguard asks. “Mind your business.”

Tannin picks up the drinks again and takes a sip from the mug in his left hand and then a sip from the one in his right.

“Fair enough,” he says, backing away. “Just trying to make friends. No offense meant.”

When he turns away, he glowers, and returns to his seat next to Tord. Watching him from the stage, Galadriel can tell that he is mentally regrouping and nowhere near done harassing this clown.

Meanwhile, Hanamir tiptoes behind the clown and his associates and nearly blends into the wall nearest to their table. He shuts out the noise of the Black Unicorn’s other patrons, and of his friend’s musical stylings, and tries to listen in. A couple of the men at the table talk over one another, making the conversation difficult to parse.

“...so don’t tell me a few weeks from now that you don’t have it ready, because I’m telling you now, all right?”

“—wait, but how do we know things won’t need to be, uh, rescheduled—”

“No, no, everything is going to go as planned,” says one of them, confidently. “Two or three weeks, and everything will be ready.”

That’s all he can pick up before an adjacent table erupts into cheers at the conclusion of a drinking game. But then, as the cheers die down, he hears something that sends a shiver down his spine: “—I don’t know, ask Number Three.”


Number Three? Another operative, then, like Number Six? How many of them are there—is six the ceiling? He makes an Irish exit out of the bar and finds a shadowy spot to lurk outside, hoping that one or more of the clown’s associates will unwittingly lead him somewhere important upon their own departure.

Back inside, Harlan snaps his fingers in front of Tord’s face to draw his attention away from yet another stein of Fantasy Miller Lite.

“Hey,” says Harlan. “You stay put, all right? I’m going to follow Hanamir and see what his plan is. If anything crazy happens with the clown, come outside and get us, okay?”

“Sure,” says Tord. 

“I’m coming with you,” says Hermione, with a glance at Tannin, who is staring with gritted teeth over at the clown, rarely blinking.

“Can I come too, Mr. Stormborne?” asks Chunk, looking troubled at the prospect of being left alone in this bar with Tannin and Tord. 

“Of course,” says Harlan. “But you’ll need to be stealthy.”

“Not a problem,” says Chunk, winking and making a quiet, uncanny meowing sound. 

Harlan decides to ignore this and leads the way toward the exit. But before he does, he casts Locate Object on the clown’s distinctive green robes. Now, in his mind, the location of those robes is like a floating buoy in a dark sea.

Across the table, Tannin addresses Tord.

“Just you and me now, bud,” he says. “Okay, help me think. If a stranger came up to you in a bar, what’s something they could say that would make you want to talk to them?”

Tord considers this a moment.

“Are you asking me for my favorite pickup line?”

“Yes, exactly!” says Tannin, pounding a fist on the table and nearly spilling both of their drinks.

“Hmm,” says Tord. “No one’s ever used one on me before. I guess they’d just have to offer to buy me a drink, probably. That’s what your friend’s been doing.”

“I tried that already!” laments Tannin. “Ugh, you’re useless. I’m going to go try again.”

He pushes back his chair and marches over to the same bodyguard who told him to get lost earlier. 

“Look who’s back,” says the bodyguard. The men at the table laugh, seeming a little more relaxed than before. A few of them are finishing their drinks.

“Yeah, it’s me,” says Tannin. “I just want to talk.”

“Come on, little man!” says the second bodyguard. “Take the hint. We’re not interested.”

“I don’t care about *you*,” sneers Tannin. “I’m hoping to get to know your clown friend here.”

“He is also not interested,” says the bodyguard. At this, the clown chuckles, but continues to refuse to acknowledge Tannin’s presence. A couple of the others at the table are now laughing uproariously. 

Tannin stalks off, blushing. He glances up at the stage and sees Galadriel watching this unfold. He glares back at her, giving a look that says “do *you* want to try?”

Galadriel finishes a song and takes a bow.

“Thank you all, you’ve been a killer crowd,” she addresses the room. “I’m Galadriel Moonwater, and if you like what you heard tonight, come back this weekend, when I’ll be debuting some brand new tunes during bottomless brunch!”

Instead of taking the backstage stairs to her dressing room, she hops down from the stage and heads to the bar, passing by the clown table on her way.

“Thanks for coming out tonight, guys!” she says, leaning on the table and flashing her most charming smile at them. “Haven’t seen you folks around here before, and I appreciate the support.”

One of the clown’s associates, who is a little tipsier than the others, raises an eyebrow.

“Pull up a chair and join us, beautiful!” he says. “You want a drink?”

“Sure,” says Galadriel, giggling a little. “I was just going to get a Fantasy PBR.”

“Allow me,” the tipsy guy says. He wanders to the bar and sets down a copper coin. “One Fantasy PBR, please!”

As he collects the drink, she sneaks a look at Tannin, who stares back, scowling. She offers him an apologetic shrug.

“So, how’d a girl like you end up at a place like this?” the guy asks, handing her the beer and leading her back to the clown table. She takes the seat next to him and looks at the others’ faces: some seem annoyed, others less so, but there’s no blanket veto on her presence the way there was with Tannin’s. 

“Oh, I’ve been performing at the Black Unicorn on and off for a little while now,” says Galadriel. “It’s the best venue for live music in the Kiln. You’ve heard of The Beholders, right? They were here just the other night. Brought down the house.”

“Cool, cool, cool,” says the guy. “I’m not in the Kiln much, though. Just here with these guys.”

She sizes up the rest of the group. They’re all fairly scary-looking dudes, which is standard for the Black Unicorn, so that’s nothing new. Quite heavily armed. All human. No discernable markers of affiliation to any organization.

“Don’t tell me you’re from uptown!” Galadriel mock-groans.

“No, but I hope to be, someday,” he smirks. “I’m on my way up in the world, you know.”

“Oh yeah?” she says. “What is it that you do?”

“Oh, I really can’t say,” he says, his smile broadening. “But in a few weeks, I’ll come back here, and I’ll buy everyone in here a round. For real. I’m about to make… more gold than you can even imagine.”

“Wait, what?” says Galadriel, playing impressed-and-dumb. “Why can’t you say?”

From the corner of her eye, she sees one of the bodyguards giving him a warning look, but he’s not paying attention.

“Listen,” he murmurs, getting closer. “You’ve seen those Amber Guard people around, right?”

At this, the bodyguard stands and comes over to grab the tipsy guy by the back of his shirt.

“All right, that’s enough,” he declares. He turns to Galadriel. “I apologize for my friend here. He’s had a little bit too much.”

He drags the man from his seat and out of the Black Unicorn entirely.

“Welp,” says Galadriel. She slides off her own chair and inches backward in the direction of Tannin and Tord. “Nice to meet you all, come again soon, thank you for supporting the arts in Aberith…” 

She ducks away into the crowd. To her relief, no one pursues her; in fact, it looks like the clown is gathering his things to leave.

“Tannin,” she says, when she pushes her way over to him. “One of those guys said he’s about to make a lot of money on a job, and it’s something related to the Amber Guard.”

“Clown is on the move,” says Tannin, standing up and clenching his fists. “Clown is on the move!”

“Meet us back at the Half-Full Flagon later,” Galadriel says to Tord, who is wholly uninterested. “All right, let’s get going.”

But Tannin is already halfway out of the bar.

“I’m not letting him out of my sight this time!” he calls back to her.
