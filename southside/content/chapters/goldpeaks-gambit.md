Before leaving, [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) nudges a boot at the ashy remains of the Amber Guardsman.

“If I’m not mistaken,” he murmurs, “this fellow may have had a Sending Stone in his hand before he blew himself up.”

“I saw that too!” says [Hermione](/characters/hermione/). “Is it in there?”

Hanamir uncovers a small stone beneath some charred textile folds that fall apart at his touch.

“Into the Bag of Holding it goes,” he says. “We don’t know what kind of message he may have sent before the blast. The extradimensional space in here is probably the safest place for it.”

[Chunk](/characters/chunk/) holds the bag open and Hanamir tosses the stone inside.

“Actually,” says [Harlan](/characters/harlan/), his eyes widening, “I think we do know what kind of message he sent.”

One of the boarded windows of the safe house is on fire. It spreads, rapidly, consuming an entire corner of the building’s facade before anyone else speaks.

“All right, let’s roll,” says [Tannin](/characters/tannin/). “I’ll carry the unconscious guy, but let’s put this dead clown inside the Bag of Holding, too. It’s a long walk uptown from the Kiln.”

Tannin and Harlan work together to dump the clown body into the Bag of Holding. [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) covers her eyes, half expecting the bag to burst and scatter its contents to the Astral Plane, but it doesn’t.

At this time of night, and with the help of Pass Without Trace, it’s not difficult to make the trek uptown without being seen. Energetically, though, the party is still running on empty; the hope that the Minister of Justice will shelter them in their current state feels a tad unrealistic.

But Tannin’s pull at the [Mirama](/characters/mirama/) estate is stronger than the rest of the adventurers realized. The guards recognize him immediately.

“McBitters!” says one, looking amused. “Look what the catfolk dragged in. It’s been awhile, my man.”

“Good to see you again, Jeremy,” says Tannin. He and the guard exchange a fistbump.  “Sorry for the unannounced visit. I need to speak to Kir. Is she awake?”

“Not quite yet,” says Jeremy. “You’re a little earlier than usual. And… you brought friends.”

“Yeah, this is my adventuring crew,” says Tannin. He shrugs his shoulders to emphasize the unconscious body he’s carrying. “And, uh, one of them is a bit worse for wear, as you can see. It’d be a huge help if you could send someone to wake the Minister.”

“Say no more,” says Jeremy. “Why don’t you all have a seat in the parlor? I’m sure she’ll be glad to see you.”

The other adventurers secretly doubt this very much, but are grateful to sit down on Mirama’s classy, understated furniture. And when she appears in the doorway, dressed in a fluffy robe and a fancy nightcap, they’re impressed at her level of chill.

“Tannin!” she says, smiling. “What can I do for you?” Her smile falters, noticing the bedraggled state of the party. “Is something wrong?”

“Afraid so, ma’am,” says Tannin. “Let me start at the beginning. There’s an underground network of clowns, and they might be ruling the city. We think they did the explosion in the Flats. There was an Amber Guard guy in league with them, and he cast Fireball on himself and died. But! He sent a signal to burn the safe house before that. I fought the clown. There’s a dead clown in this bag. The unconscious guy? We don’t even *know* what his deal is. We just escaped. Can we rest here?”

“Wait, wait, wait,” says Mirama. She winces. “Did you just tell me, the Minister of Justice, that you committed a murder and took an unconscious man prisoner? And brought him to my home?”

“Two things,” says Tannin. “One: it was self-defense. Two: if we killed anyone innocent, we’ll stand trial. But these people aren’t innocent.”

“We’ll come back to that, but... hold on, you also witnessed the suicide of a member of the Amber Guard?”

“Yeah,” says Tannin. “Hand me the Bag of Holding—”

Chunk passes it to him, and Tannin summons the stone from within. 

“He was turning this over in his hand, and then he just blew himself up. He almost took a bunch of us with him.”

Mirama waves a hand in front of her face.

“Yes, that’s one of the Sending Stones issued to the Amber Guard,” she says. “Put it back in the bag, please. It’s not traceable, but it is paired with another Stone for communication.”

“So…” says Tannin, sounding uncertain for the first time. “Can we rest here?”

“Tannin,” says Mirama, “you know I value your friendship and your service, but I have no evidence that a crime has been committed by anyone in this story, except by *you*. You’re putting me in a very awkward position right now. I can’t keep a prisoner in my home. You know this. You *must* take this matter to the proper authorities.”

“Minister Mirama, if I may?” says Harlan, with a small bow. “We ask only that you allow us to stay the night and recover from our injuries. As Tannin said, we will gladly stand trial if necessary, but please allow us to gather more information from this person we’ve restrained.  The reason we do not consult the usual authorities is that there was a member of the Amber Guard in this conflict. We have no way of knowing how much of the Guard is compromised.”

Mirama sighs. She chews on her lip for a moment before responding.

“That is true,” she says. “I suppose we’ll know who it was, once a Guardsman is reported missing from his post today. That may offer some insight.”

“So you’re in?” says Tannin, brightening again. “You’ll let us stay?”

“If it were found out that I did this, I would definitely lose my position and possibly my life,” she says. “But… I think it’s the right thing to do. There’s no way to know how deep the rot goes. This, right after [Pouru](/characters/pouru/)’s betrayal?” She sighs again. “I’ll give you the night to rest and tomorrow to gather information. But no more than that. Do you understand?”

“Yes,” says Tannin. “Thank you, Kir. Thank you.”

---

The unconscious man, whom the party has dubbed “Normie” (short for “Normal-looking guy”) spends the remainder of the night shackled in Mirama’s basement. The adventurers take turns keeping watch over him during their badly-needed rest. 

In the morning, they gather in Mirama’s kitchen over cups of coffee to discuss their interrogation plan.

“So, we all disavow torture, right?” asks Harlan.

“Totally,” says Tannin. “But I can still throw some water on him and *start* freezing it, yeah?”

“Hmm,” says Hanamir.

“He’s only going to *start* freezing it,” says Galadriel.

“Guys, so much about this feels wrong,” says Hermione. She sets her coffee cup down on the table without so much as sip. “I… I think this is it for me.”

“What do you mean?” asks Galadriel. 

“I miss my work,” Hermione sighs. “My real work. I want to track unicorns and finish my next manuscript.” She looks down, then up at each of them in turn, eyes lighting up. “It’s called *Eat, Pray, Misty Step*, and it’s a memoir about my time with you all. I think it’s going to be Aberith’s 'it' book this summer.”

“Am I in it?” asks Chunk.

“No,” says Hermione. “Anyway… I’m going to go back to the Half-Full Flagon and gather my things. I hope that weirdo [Tord](/characters/tord/) hasn’t gotten into my elven mead.”

And with that, as suddenly as she’d joined the party, Hermione was gone.

“Well,” says Harlan, coughing and then draining his cup, “shall we get to work on Normie?” 

They clamber downstairs into the basement. Galadriel dons her eyepatch again, just for dramatic effect. Normie is awake, and sits against the wall calmly, as if he had chosen to manacle himself and meditate in the corner.

“Good morning,” says Galadriel, arching the eyebrow over her eyepatch. “What is your name?”

“Yeah, answer the lady, or else,” says Tannin. He’s using his gruff voice, but he’s a little too eager. “Remember me?”

“Yes, and I suppose it’s no use lying to you all,” says the man. “My name is Easton [Goldpeak](/characters/goldpeak/).”

“Oh,” says Tannin, sharing a surprised glance with Galadriel. “I didn’t think you’d tell us.”

“I’m a relatively recognizable figure, so…” Goldpeak shrugs. “I can explain myself, if you’ll allow me.”

“Go right ahead,” says Harlan.

“These individuals approached me for financing. I was simply meeting with them. I’d decided not to pursue this opportunity, and was about to tell them so, before we were so rudely interrupted by…” he points at Tannin. “That *thing* over there.”

“Do you understand why we detained you?” asks Harlan. “Do you realize how dangerous those people are?”

“I get the sense that they were unusual characters, yes,” says Goldpeak. “Obviously, you don’t see people dressed that way every day. The way they explained it to me, they were trying to finance an archaeological mission to some distant sites containing relics of civilizations long forgotten. As a collector of art and rare curiosities, this did interest me.”

Hanamir paces back and forth across the room, listening for false notes in Goldpeak’s story, but detects none.

“Did they give you a name, or a way to contact them? How did you end up in that meeting in the Kiln?” Harlan presses.

“No, I don’t know their names,” says Goldpeak. “They approached me. I have reason to believe that some of them may be individuals from the upper echelons of society, and are seeking anonymity for that reason.”

“So they’re wealthy, but they need *you* to fund their mission?” asks Galadriel. 

“You really don’t know who I am, do you?” Goldpeak laughs shortly. “I could have lied after all, I suppose.”

“It’d be a mistake,” says Tannin. “Tell us more about these artifacts.”

“Well, I’m interested in items of artistic and historical value,” says Goldpeak. “But they were seeking items of potential magical use. Whatever the expedition found, the deal was that we’d divvy up the items along those lines.”

“And what locations were on the roadmap?” asks Harlan.

“They were primarily talking about sending a party up into the mountains. These, as I’m sure you know, are very treacherous, and it’d be costly in terms of life and in actual material goods. I was considering helping them on this, but they weren’t very forthcoming. I had the feeling that there was something they weren’t telling me.”

“And that’s why you declined?” Harlan continues.

“Yes, I suspected they had an ulterior motive,” says Goldpeak. “When you buy art, this sometimes happens. But I like to know who I’m dealing with, and I was unsettled by their appearance and their inability to be transparent with me.”

Hanamir stops pacing and stares at Goldpeak.

“The leader in that meeting mentioned something about the explosion in the Flats being a ‘debacle.’ What does that mean to you?”

Goldpeak looks unsettled.

“Oh, well, they were very troubled by what happened. They were just as upset as anyone else—a tragedy for the city, and, you know, all those lives lost.”

“I see,” says Hanamir. “And this was the first time you’ve interacted with them?”

“Yes,” says Goldpeak, firmly.

Tannin smirks and gets uncomfortably close, breathing into Goldpeak’s face.

“Funny you walked out of the deal because you didn’t hear the full story,” he says. Goldpeak grimaces and leans away. “I’m having a similar feeling here. You’re going to want to tell us everything, or it’s going to be bad news for you.”

Goldpeak, who seems particularly afraid of Tannin after his experience in the Kiln, is unusually confident in his response.

“Oh? What kind of bad news?” he scoffs. “I’m not just going to disappear. Something happens to me, it’s a year’s worth of headlines. Bad news for *you*.”

“If you won’t tell us, we’ll get the extra details from one of your clown friends we have tied up in the next room,” Tannin bluffs.

“Yes, Mr. Goldpeak, if you think we can’t make these clowns and clown associates spill their guts, you’ve got another thing coming,” says Harlan. 

Goldpeak swallows. He is silent for a moment, then speaks.

“Well, what exactly is it that you all want? How much would it take for you to let me go?” He gestures at his pockets. “I’m willing to pay in order to not be involved in any of this.”

“We want more information,” says Tannin. “We want to nab these clowns. We want justice for the city.”

“I’m afraid I don’t have that,” says Goldpeak.

“Why don’t you sit here and think about what you can offer us while we go speak to your clown friend,” Tannin says.

As they leave the room and shut the door, Chunk gasps.

“I think I do recognize that guy!” he says. “He makes that… that fizzy water. There’s a little drawing of him on the labels.”

“What fizzy water?” asks Harlan.

“I forget what it’s called, but the best flavor is Goblin Grapefruit,” says Chunk. “I’m pretty sure it’s him. It would explain why he’s so rich!”

“We’ll ask later,” says Hanamir.

---

Harlan leads them to the laundry room, where they’ve stowed the Bag of Holding.

“Wait, I thought we were going to go upstairs and regroup with Mirama? Get more information on who the Goldpeaks are?” says Galadriel. 

“Not if we can actually question the clown,” says Harlan. “I’ll cast Speak With Dead on it. Pretend to be a clown myself. Can you do clown makeup?”

“Yes,” says Galadriel, eyes widening. "*Yes.*"

They summon the corpse from the Bag. It looks just as freshly-murdered as when they stuffed it in there last night; the interior of the Bag of Holding must be a pretty tight vacuum seal. Hanamir and Tannin prop the deceased clown up against one wall while Galadriel paints blue clown makeup on Harlan’s face in a passable facsimile of the smudged green makeup the corpse wears. 

“All right,” says Harlan. “We have about ten minutes. I’m going to get as much information out of him as I can. The rest of you should stay out of sight. Especially you, Tannin.”

Hanamir, Tannin, Galadriel, and Chunk leave the laundry room and huddle outside, ears pressed to the door. They hear Harlan cast the spell. A flash of green light bursts through the cracks between the door and the jamb, and they hear the clown take a deep, rattling breath.

“Something went wrong, and we were only able to recover your body,” Harlan begins. “We’re trying to put this all back together. What happened?”

“Those people who were tracking us found us, and the stupid Amber Guard blew himself up,” rasps the clown. “I was running down the stairs of the safe house. That’s all I remember.”

“Some bad news. Goldpeak’s gone dark. What do we do?”

“Uh,” says the clown, “talk to Number Three? He’s in charge.”

“Right,” says Harlan. “As you know, the incident in the Flats didn’t go as planned. How do we do better next time?”

There’s a silence before the clown’s voice can be heard again. 

“Wait, what didn’t go as planned?”

“Well—I mean—what was your next step after that?” Harlan stammers.

“The group trying to find the eletakua might find success,” says the clown. “If they do, that’s how we get to [Slee](/characters/slee/).”

Harlan seems to take a moment to digest this, then changes tacks.

“Listen, if I could talk to Number Three right now, I’d do that, right? I wouldn’t be talking to your dead body. Things have gone sideways. How do I meet with Three?”

“What do you mean, how do you—meeting with Three, you’d just—”

The clown stops talking. There’s a loaded silence from the laundry room.

“All right, well, rest in peace, then,” Harlan says. There’s another flash of green light.

Harlan emerges from the laundry room, brows furrowed.

“You heard all that, right?” he says. “What was the word he said? *Eletakua*? And that’s how they’ll get to Slee?”

“I wonder if our favorite little Mirror might help us out here,” says Hanamir. He leads the group back into the laundry room and summons the Mirror of the Past from the Bag of Holding, and points it at the green clown’s body.

The Mirror lights up and displays a single scene from the clown’s life. He’s much younger, and not wearing clown makeup, and is actually quite handsome. He is out on a walk in the woods with a young woman. Suddenly, the woman screams. She is turning into stone. The young man watches as she becomes a statue, and he is distraught. The Mirror returns to its regular glass surface.

“Hmm,” says Hanamir. “A magical tragedy, I think. Perhaps his reason for joining the AML?”

They work together to heave the body back into the Bag of Holding and clean up any traces of blood and clown paint from Mirama’s laundry room. 

“Good enough,” says Tannin. “Back to Goldpeak?”

---

As they re-enter the room where Easton Goldpeak is shackled, Galadriel smiles warmly at him and removes her eyepatch, tossing it to the ground with unnecessary flair.

“Uh, hi,” says Goldpeak.

“Hi,” she says. “We spoke to your clown friend about the mission to get the eletakua. Was that the artifact they wanted to track down with your financial help?”

“Yes,” says Goldpeak. “They were looking for a three-sided coin, and that was the word they used for it. I was very interested, but they weren’t willing to share details about it. And that was when I became frustrated with them and decided perhaps they didn’t need my help.” He sniffs a bit. “But yes, it was supposed to take several weeks—and several thousand platinum—to take a group into the mountains and find it. They said I was welcome to whatever other treasures they might find, but they were awfully cagey about this coin.”

“See, this is the kind of information we want,” says Tannin, punching him lightly on the shoulder. Goldpeak flinches. “Now, can you connect us with these clowns in any way, even if you don’t know their names?”

“I could arrange a meeting for you,” says Goldpeak. “But you’d have to be someone they’d be interested in meeting with. Someone who might be able to suit their funding needs.”

“And you can’t just… change your mind about financing their mission?” asks Harlan.

“I’ve had my taste of action,” says Goldpeak. “I’d rather not be there when you run into them again. But if one of you could present yourself as a wealthy nobleman from elsewhere? They might bite.”

“We could have a party!” interjects Chunk. “And you can invite all the fancy folks you know—anybody from the fizzy water company—and the clowns too!”

“Wait, fizzy water company?” says Goldpeak. 

“Yeah, I figured out you’re the guy from the label on the bottle,” Chunk says proudly.

“I… do you mean Doctor Fizzleworth’s Faintly Fruity Tonic?” 

“Yes! That’s it!”

“That’s a cartoon character,” says Goldpeak. “That’s, um… I’m not him.”

“What? Are you sure?”

“Yes,” says Goldpeak. “But a party—perhaps a gala—is not a bad idea. I’d be willing to host such an event, and ensure the parties you mean to contact will be in attendance, if you promise not to—”

“We’re in,” says Galadriel, with a crazed, hungry look in her eyes. “All the way.”
