# Eavesdropping on the big boys

At the giants’ campsite, we listen to them making conversation. The older one teases the younger one about not getting too close to the water. 

We talk about our strategy: do we create an illusion to manipulate the giants before we approach? Do we distract them so we can take them by surprise? Do we wait for the third one to show up? Or do we just observe?

[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) creates the illusion of another meanlock, sitting outside the giants’ camp and watching them. One titan steps cautiously toward his great club and starts to swing at it, so Hanamir makes the meanlock jump into the bushes and out of sight. The giant pokes around the area, but loses it. 

**Young Titan:** What are those things, anyway?

**Old Titan:** Creatures that have been driven mad by fear. 

After [Chunk](/characters/chunk/) translates this, the party discusses:

**[Galadriel**](/characters/galadriel/): Uh oh. What if the king turned into a meanlock, driven mad by fear? Did we just kill the king?

**[Harlan**](/characters/harlan/): Let’s not capoeira to conclusions.

**[Tannin**](/characters/tannin/): What do we wanna know about the titans? Fears, motivations?

**Galadriel:** I wonder how they’ll react if they think the kraken is near?

She casts a minor illusion of a splashing noise in the water accompanied by a flamboyant tentacle whip on its surface.

The titans turn and look, catching sight of the tentacle. They refer to it again as the kraken.

**Old Titan:** I told you, we have to keep our distance.

# Chunk infiltrates

[Chunk](/characters/chunk/) decides to go up and approach them, speaking Giant.

**Chunk:** Help me! I don’t know where I am… what is this place?

The young titan immediately grabs him and lifts him up.

**Young Titan:** What is this thing?

**Old Titan:** I don’t know.

**Chunk:** Ah, great! You speak giant! What a relief.

**Old Titan:** It’s some kind of… little giant.

They’re confused, but not immediately aggressive.

**Chunk:** I’m a firbolg. 

**Old Titan:** Oh. We’re femorians.

**Chunk:** My name’s Chunk. 

**Old Titan:** I’m Bug Jr.

**Young Titan:** And I’m Bug the Third!

**Chunk:** Oh, another third! I’m Chunk the Third.

**Old Titan:** We’re named after bugs.

He mouths something at the other giant, but Chunk is unable to decipher it.

**Chunk:** Hey, so, did you guys hear that noise?

**Old Titan:** The kraken.

**Chunk:** Where I’m from, we say “kray-ken.”

**Old Titan:** Where are you from?

**Chunk:** The material plane. Alabama. Where y'all from?

**Young Titan:** From here. 

The older titan cracks a smile. It’s vaguely threatening.

**Chunk:** So, you guys out camping? Far from home, or…?

**Old Titan:** How did you get here?

**Chunk:** I lost a bet in a card game, and a wizard snapped his fingers, and now I’m here.

The titans seem confused by the word "wizard." They may not be cultured or worldly, or perhaps wizards as a concept are unheard of here.

**Chunk:** Can you show me to safety? How can I get home? What’s around here?

The giants talk to each other in a language Chunk doesn’t know.

**Young Titan:** We can take you to our city. You stay here with us tonight, and in the morning we take you to the city.

**Chunk:** All right then.

Chunk finds a way to signal to the party that he’s ok. He stays with the titans that night while the party camps nearby.

About an hour later, the third titan shows up. His name is Tug. He brought back some gummy animal meat, and offers Chunk a scrap of it.

# Toward the titans' city

The giants, with Chunk as guest/prisoner, lead him (and the party at a distance) back in the direction we came from for several days. After too much questioning from Chunk, they gag him, which seems overtly hostile.

We make it back to the time that looks like 7 pm. We must be parallel in some direction with the Wandering City. At this point, the giants change direction, until the it’s about noon (there were a few titan sightings on the chart at noon), and then turn again, so that they are going south.

We’re all getting a little cranky and loopy. Sleep isn’t what it is elsewhere, and none of us feel our best.

# Tiberium

We come across a grove of large crystalline structures peeping out of the ground like trees. The three titans huddle up and discuss out of earshot of Chunk, and then start harvesting the rock. 

Tannin uses his stone cunning from afar to determine that the rocks are very new, and that they only popped through the ground in the last couple of days. Tannin also realizes that the titans are speaking Undercommon when they're trying to hide things from Chunk—and that happens to be a language Tannin speaks. He hears them call the rock "tiberium."

# Breakaway

We conspire to rescue Chunk from the giants. Hanamir casts Silence on one of the giants, while Galadriel casts Blindness on the second one and Deafness on the third. We extract Chunk successfully, and he teleports us back to the Wandering City. 

The same guards from before, Trey and Tern, are on duty again. We ask them about tiberium. They say it just occurs naturally, and aren't aware that the titans value it at all. 

**Trey:** “The titans don’t know what’s valuable.” 

**Tern** agrees, and says to "think of them as animals." 

The city clears out its naturally-occurring tiberium regularly, like trash. In fact, there's a dumping ground for this: the quarry. After hearing our theory that tiberium might be a motivator for titan attacks, they send someone to lead us to the quarry.

At the quarry, we see lots of tiberium. 20-30% of the crystals glow a bluish color in the dusk. 

- Are these time telling stones? Do they get lighter as time changes? 
- It’s too fragile to build with; it shatters easily.
- Some people make jewelry with it. But mostly it’s just a byproduct of the Feywild.

# Palace plans

We return to the palace to find [Thelatha](/characters/thelatha/), and Chunk gives her the udpate. She is disappointed we didn't find the king. But we do tell her about Chunk being taken prisoner and leading toward their home, and their unusual reaction to the outcropping of tiberium. 

- We advise removing it from the city (or maybe using it to bargain for the king’s freedom if they have him…) 

**Thelatha:** There is no bargaining with these beasts. They’re savage animals who threaten to tear us apart. What would you have me do?

- We argue, but Thelatha remains frustrated and deflated, like we came back unsuccessful in our mission and are asking her for all the gravel in the city. 
- She also says the kraken is a myth, and doesn't listen when we say we saw its tentacle.
- On meanlocks, she turns sad. She calls them "mad dwarves." 

**Thelatha:** Emotions sometimes get the better of people here.

**Galadriel:** So why don't you move the city back to the material plane?

**Thelatha:** We're safe within the walls.

**Galadriel:** But not if you leave them, because you'll go mad or get eaten by giants?

**Thelatha:** You've been here for two weeks and you think you know better than we do?! The titans have killed hundreds of us. Hundreds! We have worked for decades to ensure our safety within these walls. How dare you come to me with crackpot theories about bargaining with them over rocks!

**Galadriel:** Just... will you consider it? The material plane?

Thelatha storms away, but gives us leave to take whatever "useless trash" we would like from the quarry.

# A cart pulled by a giant rabbit

We leave the city again driving a cart full of tiberium from the quarry, pulled by a giant rabbit. Harlan and Zotz circle wide overhead, and conclude that the titans’ city may be within the nearby mountains. Some femorians can be seen milling about by the entrance. Hanamir hangs back, out of sight.

At the gate, Chunk approaches speaking Giant.

**Chunk:** We come bearing gifts. We have much more of this.

**Some titan:** Where did you find such bounty?

**Chunk:** There’s a place of untouched tiberium that I can show you.

**Some titan:**  Where, little giant?!

**Chunk:** I’ll tell you, but you have to promise not to eat us.

The titan laughs.

**Some titan:** Deliver what you have to the city. Then show us.

He pockets a little bit of the tiberium before ushering Chunk and the others on the cart into the mountains.
