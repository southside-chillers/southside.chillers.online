[Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) hides her face in her sleeve. Dust, heavy with airborne rocks, hits her like an ocean wave from the doorway and knocks her backward to the floor. The birds above her go silent.

“Oh, come on,” she groans to herself. She spits and blinks and sneezes, finding her way back to her feet. “Was it Call Lightning? I bet he cast Call Lightning.”

She peers back through the passageway, now a mess of fallen rock. There are no magenta lights to be seen. 

“I hope they got out of the way, at least,” she says, with a sudden pang of fear, followed by the creep of guilt for her flippant initial reaction. An idea occurs to her.

*[Buddy](/characters/buddy/)? Can you still hear me? she thinks.*

She waits for an answer, but there is no sound except the gradual return of activity in the canopy above. She catches a glimpse of another ape in the greenery to her right. It watches her without making a move.

*Okay. It’s possible that everyone I care about has just died. It’s possible that I’m alone now. For good.* 

Her breath catches in her throat.

*But in case that’s not true… what would they want me to do?*

An answer comes to her, and she forces herself breathe deeply, as if to prove to herself that she’s remaining calm.

*They know where I am. I’ll conjure up a little hut, and I’ll take a nice nap.* 

She hums a tune to herself as she casts Leomund’s Tiny Hut. It’s something her mother used to sing, but she forgets the words. The rainbow-colored walls and roof of the hut spring into existence around her and block out the world.

“All right!” she says aloud. “Time to restore some feelings of well-being and magical ability!!!!” 

She unfurls the deluxe black silk bedroll she purchased back in Aberith (to replace the one that was stabbed to shreds during the encounter with the basilisk). Despite it being mid-afternoon, she’s confident she could jump inside it and sleep for nigh on fourteen hours. Her shifts at the Black Unicorn combined with her training schedule with Yasaria’s drow assassin squad has left her chronically sleep-deprived for the past several weeks.

And she isn’t wrong. She drifts off to a swift but uneasy slumber. 

In her dreams, she’s somewhere she’s been before. It’s the temple, and it’s not, but it’s just like this, and she’s full of dread… 

Of course! It’s the room where she walked in on [Magick](/characters/magick/), in another dream, not long ago… when Magick was hurting someone, someone she loved… 

Heart pounding, she steps forward, and she can finally see the object of the torture, and it’s exactly what she feared. A copper dragon—*Buddy*!—is restrained by some malevolent spell, his life slipping away—she pleads with Magick for mercy, but the tiefling doesn’t even glance in her direction, so focused on her brutal task—

*This is a dream,* some part of her conscious mind interrupts. *You’re dreaming.*

What happens next? In the original dream, she stepped forward and uttered a word that stopped Magick and ended her life instantly… but what was the word? She scans her memories frantically. What was the word that saved Buddy? 

*Only the Lich knows the word,* she realizes. *The word was his offer.* 

She startles awake, clammy and terrified. It’s still mid-afternoon, judging by the light filtering through the lava-lamp walls of the hut. 

*Buddy?* she thinks. *Are you there?*

She drifts back to sleep waiting for his answer.

On the other side of the cave-in, the mood is not great. [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) is picking gravel out of his beard, while [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) pours a cup and a half of fine-grained dust out of one of his boots. [Hermione](/characters/hermione/), Magick, and Buddy were far enough away that they are physically untouched, but Magick rocks back and forth in a fetal position on the floor. [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) stares at the rubble in surprise and a fair amount of horror.

“What?!” he repeats, again and again. “But—but it was *lightning*, not thunder!”

“Yes, Harlan,” says Hanamir, a little snippy. “Who could possibly have seen this coming?”

“But I—” starts Harlan, then stops, not knowing where that sentence was going anyway. 

Tannin pokes around the ruined passageway with his trident, an arm over his mouth.

“It’ll take us awhile to dig through here,” he reports. “Like, I’m talking weeks, probably.”

“We’re not going to go through it,” says Hanamir. “We’re going to turn back the way we came and find a different way around.”

“Sounds good to me,” says Tannin. He punches Harlan in the shoulder, laughing. “You really screwed up big time, my man!”

“Yes I did,” says Harlan, eyes downcast. “I’m sorry everyone. I really, really didn’t mean for that to happen.”

They trudge back to the cat room. 

“Two more options, team,” says Hanamir. He nods at a set of bronze doors inlaid with lighter stone patterns, and another set of iron doors with heavy wooden slats running left-to-right. “Door number one or door number two?”

“Definitely the pretty door,” Hermione pipes up from the back of the group. “The stone pattern one. The other one looks like it goes to a dungeon.”

“I’m going to defer decision-making to others for the time being,” says Harlan.

“Works for me,” says Hanamir. He leads the way through the stone patterned doors into an L-shaped hallway. They progress slowly behind him, alert for pressure plates or tripwires, but it proves to be free of traps. 

The hallway culminates in a short staircase leading up to a spacious room that reminds Hermione of an empty terrarium and Hanamir of a zen garden after centuries of blight. In the center of the room is a pond of what looks like oily water. A gnarled and withered tree stands in the water.

“No wonder it’s dead,” whispers Hermione. “No sunlight in here. Why have an indoor garden if you can’t maintain it?”

“I don’t trust it,” says Hanamir. “You all stay back; I’m going to see what happens if I move closer.”

He dashes along the left side of the room, clutching the eight-foot pole defensively.

Sure enough, as he passes, the tree begins to move; its bark crackles and groans as it opens a single eye in the middle of its trunk and unfurls its twisted branches like a sea creature’s tentacles. It makes a blundering grab at Hanamir, but he’s far too quick for it.

“Ha!” cries Tannin, following Hanamir in a dash across the room. “Too slow!”

The tree grunts in frustration as its next swipe at Tannin is, again, a few seconds too late. 

“It is pretty slow,” Hanamir calls to Harlan. “I think all of us can probably speed through here.”

“Are you sure?” says Harlan. “Even Magick? She’s still freaking out back there.”

“I think now is the time for speed,” says Hanamir. “If our goal is to reunite with Galadriel as soon as we can. At least, that is my goal.”

“No, no, that’s my goal too,” says Harlan. A note of worry has crept into his voice. “I just… what if this doesn’t actually lead us to where she is? And we need to come back through here and go another way? I think we should make sure that our way back is free of murderous tentacle trees in case we need to escape from something even worse…”

As he makes this argument, the tree turns toward him and bellows with a sound like a paper shredder with a metal binder clip stuck in it. It is gaining a little bit of speed as it wakes up from its probably ages-long slumber.

“Damn,” says Harlan. His path is blocked by six fanning tentacles. “Okay, here goes.” He casts Sacred Flame and hits the tree directly in the face. It reels backward, then makes an indignant grab at Harlan with a tentacle branch. It lifts him up into the air and shakes him like a baby with a rattle.

Hanamir frowns deeply. If he were the type of person to sigh and exclaim “AGAIN?” he’d do so, but instead he centers his mind, focuses on his breath, and launches a set of darts at the back of the tree. One of them sticks, but the others ricochet off of its bark.

“Its hide is particularly tough, it seems,” he announces to the room. “Like petrified wood.”

The single dart is not enough to distract the tree from its prey. It holds Harlan in front of its face like a corn on the cob and takes a big bite.

“Oh, jeez,” says Tannin. “Eaten by a bag of bread and then eaten by a tree? Not on my watch!” 

He flies into a rage and throws his trident at the tree’s trunk, but it, too, bounces right off and clatters to the ground.

Harlan, whose bite wound rains blood onto the floor with every passing second, flails in the grip of the tentacle and swings his hammer however he can. In a bit of luck, it hits the tree in its single giant eye.

“Hold on, bud,” says Hanamir, his crankiness forgotten. He leaps up onto the tree’s back and begins sawing furiously at the tentacle that has hold of Harlan. The tree stomps back and forth in an attempt to shake him off, but soon Hanamir has hacked completely through. The branch falls off, and Harlan with it, to thud heavily against the floor.

The tree, now making a noise like a woodchipper being force-fed a fax machine, directs all five of its remaining tentacles to pick Hanamir off of its back. It grabs him and brings him around to its mouth to bite him, but Hanamir lands a swift punch to its eyeball. It then holds him as far away from its trunk as it can.

“Okay, trying again,” says Tannin. He has retrieved his trident from where it fell and now takes another, more forceful stab at the tree. It hits. But the tree has decided to leave it all on the mat today, and it plucks Tannin from the floor with a tentacle and takes a vicious bite out of his midriff.

Now Harlan is the only combatant not held by the tentacle tree. He casts another Sacred Flame, summoning the most powerful radiant energy he can. Large cracks begin to appear in the tree’s bark, widening to canyons. It’s deeply upsetting to the tree, and in the distraction, Tannin takes a final stab at the tree’s large single eye. He skewers it, and it must be the tree’s only vital organ, because the tree’s branches go limp and release the dwarf and the half-orc from its clutches. The two of them take a moment to lie there on the floor and collect their strength. Finally, Tannin sits up and addreses Harlan.

“Next time you see the barbarian running?” he says. “You run too!”

“I’m sorry,” says Harlan. “Again. I’m not having a good streak here.” He casts Healing Word on Tannin’s tree bite wound by way of apology.

Hanamir says nothing, but gives Harlan a nod that indicates all is forgiven. Tannin is already distracted and rummaging through the shell of the dead tree’s trunk.

“It’s a treasure piñata!” Tannin cries. He holds up several large pieces of blue jasper. Hanamir joins him.

“Look at this,” says Hanamir, turning a simple silver rod over in his hands. “I wonder what this does?”

“Aha!” says Harlan. “That, my friend, is a Wand of Lightning Bolts.” He smiles fondly and waves a hand. “But I’ve got all the lightning we need right here.” His smile falls. “Though… lightning hasn’t been a great tool for us lately, anyway.”

“You want it, Tannin?” asks Hanamir. “For later? As in, when we are no longer in this very fragile ancient temple?”
 
“A dwarf with a wand?” says Tannin. He’s looking at it with a mixture of curiosity and skepticism. “What would my brethren say?”

“Let them say whatever they want,” shrugs Hanamir, who has no problem behaving unusually for a half-orc.

“If you don’t want to be laughed out of dwarven society, you could disguise it somehow—affix it to your trident, and then you’d have a weapon that commands fish AND fries them on demand,” suggests Harlan.

Tannin does seem intrigued by this idea. He takes the wand, “just for now.”

Harlan goes back to the hallway to tell Hermione, Magick, and Buddy that it’s safe for them to come through the room now. 

“Any sign of Galadriel?” asks Hermione. 

Harlan shakes his head, his guilt turning into real concern. He searches his pockets until he finds a simple silver whistle. “I’ll use this, just in case we’re close enough to Galadriel that she can hear us. And at least then she’ll know we’re on our way.” 

But this turns out to be unnecessary, as they find that the next set of doors leads them to the very same jungle room containing their lost half-elf friend. They can see Galadriel’s hut across the room.

“Whew,” he says.

Hanamir holds up a hand indicating silence and caution. He scans the room for threats and notes the small group of apes who are sniffing at the hut with curiosity. The adventurers pop back through the doors for a second to talk.

“Want me to do Speak with Animals?” says Tannin. “Those apes don’t look hostile. I can probably convince them to back down. We’d just need to wait ten minutes.”

“She’s been waiting for us this long,” says Hermione. “Another ten minutes can’t hurt.”

Ten minutes pass, and Tannin tries out a few ape-like grunts. They really suit him.

He strides confidently into the jungle room and waves to the apes, who look surprised, but still not aggressive. 

“Howdy,” says Tannin. “Just a heads up. My friends and I are here and we don’t mean you any harm. Want these?” 

He holds out a few pieces of the blue jasper, then chucks them over to a far corner of the room. The apes watch with interest. 

“All yours!” he motions toward them, and the apes lumber off to collect the shiny rocks.

Tannin knocks on the side of hut. Then he looks back and waves the other adventurers to come on in. Galadriel appears, banishing the hut and its pizza-smelling walls into thin air. She looks groggy but ecstatic.

“I knew you were all right!” she says, giving Tannin a bear hug. 

Buddy nudges her shins and she leans down and kisses his head. She and Harlan exchange a look of understanding. She hugs him too. “Glad you’re okay,” she says.

“We’re low on energy and at least a few of us have pretty serious bite wounds from a tree,” says Hanamir. “Want to spin up another hut and get a long rest going?”

“Absolutely,” says Galadriel. But before she does, a ten-foot python makes an attack on Tannin.

“I just wanna go to bed!” laments Tannin, and the rage he summons is full of exhausted fury. He wrestles the snake and at least holds its constriction at bay for a moment while Harlan gets a good hit with the hammer on the snake’s latter half, flattening it. Tannin succeeds in escaping the snake during this distraction. Once he’s out, Harlan finishes off the snake with another swing to its head. 

“I need a NAAAAAP!” Tannin roars at the sky. A few birds flutter away.

“Say no more,” says Galadriel. She summons another hut. The background noise of the jungle animals fades to a murmur.

The adventurers each settle in for a long rest. The vibe is one of exhaustion, disbelief, and gratitude that a stopping point has been reached and that safety, at least for now, is something they can count on.

They sleep through the entire evening and into the night. Hermione, as a full-blooded elf, is the only one with a reduced need for sleep, so she awakens in the pitch blackness and uses her darkvision to read. The rest of them remain unresponsive until sunlight begins creeping through the translucent walls of the hut.

“Brand new day,” sighs Tannin. He stretches his arms over his head. “Man, I needed that.” He smacks his lips and looks around. “Let’s see what the bread bag’s got for us today, huh? ”

He retrieves the satchel from his pile of belongings at the foot of his bedroll. Harlan shuts his eyes and grimaces.

“Ugh. I don’t even want to watch,” he mutters.

“All right. I’m feeling lucky. No whammies, no whammies,” says Tannin.

He unties the drawstring and plunges a hand inside.
