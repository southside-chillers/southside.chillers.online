Cal is on a quest for revenge against Lord Deladriel. As he tells the story:

# The Saga of Cal Verslun

"Where I grew, life was simple...and quiet. I come from a relatively small village of wood elves. We were farmers, peaceful people. For generations my family worked the lands, passed on our skills. We were content with our place in the world. Most of the year we harvested and traded with the larger nearby towns. Nature provided for us, and we were happy with our place in life."

"All that changed one night. "

"I was returning late one evening from a week in the forest gathering supplies when I started to pick up a hint of burning thatch in the air. Dropping everything, I bolted towards a faint orange glow far off in the distance. It grew brighter and hotter, the smell of cinder getting more intense, mixed with the smell of flesh. Breaking through the tree line, I saw my village engulfed in flames, homes and bodies burning. In the distance I could see the faint outline of goblins running into the night, along with the sound crunching metal and snapping branches. I ran as fast I could to my house only to see the it engulfed, every attempt to enter, I just getting burned over and over, my arms, my body ... almost everywhere. "

"I rushed to the nearest large town to seek assistance. All of our villages and towns were part of a larger community collective. I knew someone from the local noble's house would be able to help. Getting closer to the compound, I saw the same goblin silhouettes entering. Fearing the worst, I rushed in, using my skills to conceal myself and hopefully surprise the enemies before they could cause similar destruction. "

"But as I climbed the compound fence..." (Cal pauses, staring into the distance, his eyes filling with rage)

"Two metal constructs stood, flanking a mysterious hooded figure, dozens of goblins roaming the courtyard behind them. In front, stood the head of the Sylvan noble house. It was clear from the exchange that this was not an engagement of violence, but rather a confirmation of partnership through horrific deeds. I could barely make out a few words. I heard the nobleman refer to the hooded figure as Deladriel, an elven name. In my rage, I gave away my position. I ran, disappearing into the night, but not before catching a glimpse of the hooded figure, an elf with a demonic visage. "

"As morning broke, I returned home, discovering the charred remains of my parents and siblings. I took this pendant from his sister’s body (Cal holds up a necklace of playful fey creature), as well as supplies and weapons. In pain, both from the loss and the fire, I set off into the woods once more, my only company was that name, 'Deladriel.'"

"Since that night, I have hunted this demon, devoting everything I have to finding him and ending him."
