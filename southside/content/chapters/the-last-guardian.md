The adventurers press onward, to the northwest, and out of the grove. The mountains—mere hazy blue ghosts when seen from Aberith—now loom ahead like sleeping giants, shrinking the sky as they approach.

Overhead, atop Zotz, [Harlan](/characters/harlan/)’s voice is all but lost in the wind that thunders over the plains.

“....head! … band… camp…! ...round… ashes…” 

“Huh?” [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) shouts back at him through hair whipping around her face.

“Ahead! There’s an abandoned! Campsite! Surrounded by! Ashes!” Harlan tries again.

“I’ll go take a look,” says [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/). As the dusk deepens, he finds more and more opportunities to Shadowstep, evaporating into patches of darkness and materializing yards away.

When [Tannin](/characters/tannin/), [Chunk](/characters/chunk/), and Galadriel catch up, Hanamir is kneeling next to the campsite and summoning the Mirror of the Past from the Bag of Holding. True to Harlan’s report, the site is surrounded by a thin circle of black ash. At its center, over the remains of a campfire, lies the partially-consumed carcass of a wild animal.

“Looks like orcs were here, to my eye,” says Hanamir, inspecting the deep notches in the creature’s bones. He twirls the Mirror in one hand. “Now, let’s see if I’m right.”

“How about these ashes?” asks Tannin. He swipes a boot through the neatly-drawn circle, breaking it. “Is that an orc thing? Do you know what they’re for?”

“I do not,” says Hanamir. “But if we consult the Mirror—”

Galadriel swipes a finger down into the circle of ash and licks it.

“[Kord](/characters/kord/) almighty! Do you ever learn?” says Harlan. He closes his eyes in exasperation. “Last time you did that to an unknown substance, your tongue went invisible.”

“Tastes like... burnt wood,” she says, making a face, and studiously ignoring Harlan.

“We must have just missed these folks,” says Chunk, peering down at the large boot tracks around the campsite. “Looks like they headed roughly back where we just came from.”

Without delaying further, Hanamir shines the mirror at the site. The glass shows a group of four orcs setting up camp there the previous night. One of them takes a small bag and spreads the ash in a circle around them all.

“It looks like it’s just a chore for him,” says Chunk. “Nothing ritualistic or sacred to it.”

“But... why?” says Harlan. 

“Perhaps we’ll never know,” says Hanamir. He frowns, in apparent dissatisfaction.

Night falls over the windy plains. No one says much as they set up camp. The frustrated questions bounce between them like the chill in the air. 

Are they missing something—something important—about the orcs and their ash circle? 

...about the diseased and distressed forest, and the belligerent woads? 

Are there clues passing them by, like the relentless wind? 

What of the clowns, the three-sided coin, the explosion in Aberith? 

What of [Cazna](/characters/cazna/)? Of Lolth? 

What of the Lich?

An unsatisfying sleep, bearing no answers, ferries them to the next morning.

---

Tannin awakens the others as the sun nears (but has not yet begun) its rising. Galadriel points this out to him in tones frostier than the ground beneath them.

“Tannin,” she enunciates, “it is night time.”

“I had a weird dream,” he counters.

“Tell me about it in two…” she pauses. “In four hours.”

But Hanamir is already dressed and returning his things into his backpack, pleased to get a head start on the morning’s walking.

“If we leave now, we’ll reach the foothills even sooner than expected,” he notes. “What was the dream about, Tannin?”

“I… can’t remember,” he says, staring ahead at the ground.

“Ooh, we’ve got Pensive Tannin today,” says Harlan. He turns to Chunk. “Sometimes he gets like this when he’s had a deep thought.”

“Oh, me too,” says Chunk, mistaking Harlan’s snark for earnestness. “If I reckon too hard on, you know, the big questions? I’ll be in my head reckonin’ all day long.”

The adventurers reach the foothills even faster than Hanamir had anticipated. As the ground elevation rises, the frost becomes a light dusting of snow beneath their feet. Tannin leads the way, still taciturn as the morning ripens. As they round a bend in the road, he stops in his tracks.

“What’s up, McBitters?” says Galadriel.

Tannin points ahead to a wooden sign inscribed with Dwarvish letters.

“What’s it say?” asks Harlan.

Tannin says nothing, but Hanamir, who took three years of Dwarvish at Drephis State, translates.

“It says, ‘Estate of [Borgrear](/characters/borgrear/) Snowmantle,’” he says. “Who’s that? Do you know him, Tannin?”

“Maybe,” says Tannin.

He walks ahead, without explaining anything.

“Well, all right, then,” says Chunk. He shrugs and follows Tannin. The rest of the party takes his lead.

Borgrear Snowmantle’s aforementioned Estate comes into view around the next steep bend in the road. A mansion—stone, and built to dwarf-scale—leans against the side of the low mountain, as if weary of standing. Beyond, a few small huts sit at the edge of a frozen lake. Tannin begins jogging toward the mansion.

“Wait up!” says Harlan. “Hey, can we get a little background information here?”

“Yeah,” says Galadriel. “Tannin, you’re from the mountains, right? *These* mountains?”

“Does the architecture of that mansion look strange to anyone?” says Hanamir. “Too modern, perhaps, to be as ancient as it looks?”

“I don’t know about ancient,” says Chunk. “Run-down is more like it.”

Tannin slows down and heaves a sigh that is visible in the chilly air. 

“Just follow me,” he says. “I don’t know how to explain this yet.”

He leads them silently into the village, through the cluster of small huts, whose doors hang off their hinges and creak with every gust of wind. Chunk points out a nest of waterfowl inside one of them. Other than that, however, there are no signs that anyone’s lived inside in recent years.

A loud hiss from Zotz makes all of them jump. 

“Whoa, buddy,” says Harlan, who leads him on foot. “What was that for?”

Zotz hisses again, insistently. Following the giant bat’s gaze, the adventurers notice a small dog with a light brown coat and a silly, squished face, standing a ways away, wagging its curled nub of a tail. With a *pop*, it abruptly disappears from sight.

“What the—” says Harlan.

“A blink dog!” says Chunk. “At least, that’s what I think it’s gotta be.”

“What’s a blink dog?” asks Galadriel.

In answer, the squat little dog reappears across the street. It runs in a small circle and then stops, panting.

“They’re from the Feywild,” says Chunk. “Not usually seen here.”

“Here, puppy!” says Harlan. He pulls a piece of owlbear jerky from a pocket and holds it out in an open palm.

“I might need a refresher on the Feywild vis-à-vis… what… that is,” says Galadriel.

“Certainly,” says Hanamir. “As you might remember from *The Idiot’s Guide to the Planes*, the material plane—that’s us—is flanked directly above and below by two planes, the Feywild and the Shadowfell. The Shadowfell is a place of darkness, of depression—not to be confused with evil.” Hanamir holds up a cautioning finger. “And the Feywild is a place of energy and excitement—*not* to be confused with good.”

“Aww, but this little guy’s good, right?” Galadriel coos. 

The dog yaps and makes another excited circle in the inch or so of snow. It approaches Harlan’s outstretched hand, but then sniffs the air and turns away. It pops out of existence and reappears in a shadow next to one of the abandoned huts. 

“Must not like Zotz’s smell any more’n Zotz likes his,” says Chunk. “Tough to say no to owlbear jerky!”

“I bet I can win him over,” says Hanamir. He picks up a stick and tosses it in a high arc across the street. Then he Shadowsteps across the street himself to catch it.

But the little brown dog isn’t tempted. Instead, a second, slightly terrifying dog leaps out from the shadows, almost slipping on its long, spindly legs in the snow. It waits by Hanamir’s feet, its bony black frame shaking with anticipation of another stick toss. 

“Oh, hello,” says Hanamir. He reaches down and pats it on the head. Despite looking mildly creepy, the dog seems sweet. “Another friend.” 

The little brown dog starts running toward the mansion, and its lanky friend follows after it.

“Don’t tell me,” says Galadriel. “That one’s a stowaway from the Shadowfell?”

Tannin stares past the dogs at the mansion, still not speaking. He begins walking in the trail of pawprints toward the stern, forbidding entrance.

“All right, guess we’re checking out the house now,” says Harlan. “Maybe someone lives in there.”

“I wonder,” says Hanamir. “The entire village looks abandoned.”

The door—intact, unlike most of the doors on the village huts—is unlocked. Tannin pushes it open and walks in without so much as a knock. 

“Hello?” Harlan calls. He sticks his head inside and peers left and right. “Anyone home?”

The state of the mansion’s foyer is, to Hanamir’s mind, indescribable, but Galadriel might characterize it as belonging to someone with both a desperate hoarding problem and an aggressive disregard for all material possessions. The air inside smells densely of smoke; there is a small trash fire crackling gently in the middle of the floor. A low, groaning wind rattles through the gaps in the walls and buffets papers and small objects loose from the stacks where someone has piled them up to the ceiling in haphazard arrangements throughout the room. The ceiling sags in a way that Chunk would describe as “not right.”

Seated in a collapsed chair next to the burning debris, shrunken and hunched, is a stunningly ancient-looking dwarf man. The two dogs settle at his feet. Slowly, and with what seems like great effort, he raises his head to regard the five intruders to his odd domestic scene. After a moment, he nods at Tannin and says something to him in halting, wispy Dwarvish.

“What do you call yourself?” says the old man. 

Hanamir, standing back, translates for the others in a whisper. 

“Tannin McBitters,” says Tannin. He’s silent for a moment. “Are you Borgrear Snowmantle?”

“McBitters, McBitters…hm…” Borgrear trails off. “What brings you this way?”

“We were just passing through,” says Tannin. “But when I saw the sign, I had to stop by.”

“And why’s that?”

“Snowmantle…” Tannin trails off. He looks at the old man as if awaiting confirmation. 
 
“Yes,” says Borgrear, “there were once many of us.” He clears his throat, and his voice becomes marginally less frail. “I myself traveled far from the tribe a long time ago to take up my residence here. Are you descended from the Snowmantles?”

“I don’t know,” says Tannin. “There was a journal… from a Gunnloda Snowmantle. It was dear to my clan. But it’s lost now.”

Borgrear falls silent and closes his eyes. He sits like this for a long time, while the firelight makes golden patterns on his face.

“I cannot number the winters since that name last found my ears,” he says. “Gunnloda was my younger cousin. And she left… and I left too… and I never knew what became of her. You are related to her, then? But you are not a Snowmantle?”

“I don’t know,” says Tannin. “I… don’t know the lineage.”
 
“The books… all the books are gone. I brought family histories here with me, but they were in the city,” says Borgrear. “And the city is no more.”
 
“What city?” says Tannin. “What happened to it?” 

“Wandered away…” Borgrear says. “As it was cursed to do. To the Wild, or to the Darkness. Or perhaps… perhaps I dreamed it. Perhaps it was never here.”

Hanamir takes a moment to translate this, his brow furrowed.

“I really think ‘wandered away’ is the best translation for what he said, but I can’t tell if he’s being literal or just poetic,” he whispers.

“Either way, the city was cursed, and now it’s gone? So, maybe it’s the city from that book about the three-sided coin?” hisses Harlan. “Though I thought the book said it was a whole *kingdom* …”

Galadriel is transfixed on the dramatic scene between the two dwarves. If she had a bag of popcorn, she’d be shoveling it in her mouth by the handful.

“You guys!” she elbows them. “Look at how cool and serious Tannin can be when he gets to speak in Dwarvish!”

The old man takes a deep, wheezy breath, and continues.

“My job was to watch. To wait for the city to return. To keep this place sacred.” 

He gestures out a large picture window behind him at a barren field that stretches far beyond the hamlet. 

“But… it never did. I took the trials as a young dwarf, so many years ago. And the ones who entrusted me to this task… I feel like I have failed them.” His voice falters. “But I do not know how.”

“Trials?” says Tannin.

“Yes,” says Borgrear. “There are three trials one must pass to become a Guardian.” He holds up three fingers and counts them off. “A trial of stone. A trial of spirit. And a trial of shadow.”

“What do you have to do?” says Tannin. 

“The trials are different for all who attempt them,” says Borgrear. “For me… I fought a creature I’d never seen before. I was sealed underground and burrowed my way out. And then… there was one that I’m still uncertain if I truly did pass.”

“And if you passed, you’d get the job, which is just to wait here for the city to come back?” asks Tannin. The adventurers recognize the early snap of rage in his voice.

“And to keep this place sacred for its eventual return, yes,” says Borgrear. “I was not always the only one. There were three of us who had made this commitment. This was the way of things.” He glances out the window at the empty field. “But now, you see that I am not the young dwarf I used to be. My two colleagues have passed from this life, and my time is fast approaching. And still… the city has not returned.”

“Have you ever seen it?” says Tannin. “The city? Or was it gone when you started this job?”

“I saw it once,” says Borgrear wistfully. “Only for a matter of days. I happened upon it after setting out from the Snowmantle clan... and it changed my entire perspective. I fell in love with it. A jewel among dwarven cities—never have I seen such a marvel.” 

“Have you ever tried, I don’t know, *looking* for it?” Tannin’s voice has a hard edge to it. “Or do you just sit here?”

“My duty is to stay here and make sure that this place is kept sacred,” says Borgrear. 

“But you’re burning trash on the floor,” says Tannin. “You’re a mess. How is that sacred?”

Borgrear points to the window. At the edges of the empty field sit piles of rocks and of wood.

“This is my task,” says Borgrear. “The field must be cleared. The work is more than I can handle alone, but I do it—things on this plane affect the Darkness and the Wild in ways that are not well understood. I have no energy to spare on myself.”

“Old man…” Tannin’s voice rises in anger. “This place you claim to love will die with you unless you take action. Will you wait until you die?” 

“What am I to do?” asks Borgrear. “The city might be in the Darkness. It might be in the Wild. I was entrusted to keep this place sacred for its return.”

“And the dogs?” asks Tannin.

Borgrear pats the shadowy dog on its bony head. It nuzzles his hand.

“They have been my sole companions since the other two Guardians passed on,” says Borgrear.

Galadriel, out of an abundance of caution, casts Mage Hand, and uses it to pat the blink dog on the head.

“The little round one is Spice,” says Borgrear, with a faint smile. “The skinny one is Umbra.”

The adventurers take a moment to admire the puppies. But Tannin remains stone-faced.

“We are looking for an artifact that has the power to shift entire kingdoms from this plane,” he says. “Do you know of this artifact?”

“I know nothing of an artifact,” says Borgrear. “I was told of a curse.” He looks around at the filthy foyer. “You are welcome to stay here, if you wish. It has been long since I’ve had visitors.”

“We’ll find it,” says Tannin. “The artifact. And we’ll pass back through here, and we’ll bring the city back.”

He kicks a piece of stray debris into the fire and storms off, evidently done with being a serious talker. Hanamir steps forward and bows politely. In somewhat faltering Dwarvish, he continues addressing Borgrear.

“Sir, can you tell us about these other Guardians?” he asks. “Did they live here with you?”

“Not in this house,” says Borgrear. “In the other houses. At each point of the valley below.”

“Oh,” says Hanamir. He squints out the window and can just make out two other, similar mansions. “Looks like a long walk.”

“Ah, but the doors...” says Borgrear. He waves at two unremarkable closet doors to his left and right. “These doors… one may step through this door and emerge in the house to the northeast. And step through that door and emerge in the house to the northwest.”

“But… how?” asks Chunk. “Are they endowed with the same curse as the city?” 

Hanamir translates. Borgrear looks at Chunk and takes a long moment to think.

“I do not know how the doors work,” he says. “But you may use them yourself, if you would like.”

The adventurers all exchange curious looks. 

“Mr. Snowmantle, you’ve been an enormous help to us,” says Hanamir. “Is there anything we can assist you with, sir? Anything we might bring you?”

“Only relief from my responsibilities would lift the burden on my soul,” says Borgrear. “Only death can ease my pain.”

“Ah,” says Hanamir.

He sweeps up a bit around the room, bothered by its disorder. Then he takes out some rations from his backpack and makes Borgrear a sandwich. The old dwarf accepts it, looking faintly amused. The sandwich livens him up a little.

“Yes, use the doors,” he says. “But do not enter the field, lest you would face the trials yourselves.”
