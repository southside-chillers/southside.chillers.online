[Harlan](/characters/harlan/) joins [Hermione](/characters/hermione/) at the window. 

“One of them is shouting orders,” he whispers to [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) and [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/), who are drawing their weapons. “Can’t understand him, but it looks like he’s telling them to fan out. I don’t think they know anyone’s in here.”

“Care to take advantage of that?” says Hanamir.

In response, Harlan casts Shatter on the band of orcs before they can spread out too much. A blast of thunder hits the orcs head on, and the entire city seems to quake. Two of the orcs are knocked backward, while some of the others are stunned for a moment as the thunder ricochets off the stone buildings and fades away. 

There’s a brief moment of silence before another reality-shredding noise splits the air. 

“Now what?” sighs Harlan. The adventurers brace themselves for another legion of orcs to materialize.

But this second rip in spacetime erupts with oceanwater and belches out just one humanoid, too short to be an orc, wielding a golden trident. A couple of small fish fall out of the portal with him and flap tepidly against the ground.

“Guys… I think it’s [Tannin](/characters/tannin/)! You guys!!!” Harlan tries to keep his voice at a whisper just in case the orcs somehow weren’t able to tell where the Shatter spell came from. 

“WHAT?!” yelps Galadriel, blowing any cover they might have had. She leaps over to peer out the window. Sure enough, it’s Tannin, but he’s got full-on *Castaway* hair now, with a few barnacles stuck in there for good measure. He stands on the street, shaking sand and pieces of seaweed off of his legs. “Why is he nautical-themed now?”

“He returns to us in a time of great need,” says Hanamir. 

Indeed, Tannin’s sudden appearance has diverted the front line of orcs away from the adventurers inside the tavern, for the time being. 

“Take out the dwarf first!” the orc leader commands. Hanamir translates for the non-Orcish speakers. 

“Not so fast,” says Hermione, to no one in particular. “I haven’t had a chance to introduce myself yet.” She casts Ray of Sickness on one of the orcs, and he immediately sinks to his knees, vomiting. Harlan takes out another one with a second cast of Shatter.

The bat riders ascend to circle over the soggy barbarian and throw spears down at him. Orc footsoldiers surround him, swords drawn. 

“This seems about right,” says Tannin, grimacing. Out of the corner of his eye, he notices the faces of Harlan, Galadriel, and Hanamir crammed into the narrow tavern window. He chuckles and gives them a goofy wave, then goes back to staring down the approaching orcs with steely-eyed intensity.

Three orcs swing at him at once. He takes a grisly cut to his side, but doesn’t seem perturbed. He launches into his trademark rage and swings his trident in a reckless attack against the group of orcs—but then he does something curious. He uncorks a flask and spills a puddle of water on the ground at their feet. He looks over at the tavern window again, checking to see if his friends are watching the cool thing he’s about to do, but they have been accosted by the other half of the orcs.

“Damn, I guess I’ll wait,” mutters Tannin. In the meantime, he dodges another spear from a bat-rider and tosses a stray jellyfish at one of the orcs, beaning him right in the mouth. Then he whirls around and tridents another guy in the neck.

Inside the tavern, the skeletons’ attempt at a barricade is reduced to splinters by a blast of Thaumaturgy from a cloaked orc mage with bony white hands. Another orc, so huge he could pass for part-troll, bursts through the threshold and takes a slice out of Hanamir with his axe. Galadriel, who has scaled a wall, jumps down onto the big guy and stabs him in the back with her rapier. She rolls off of him just in time for Harlan to bring down his maul directly on the giant orc’s skull. There is a surprisingly large splatter radius, and it is an egregious health code violation. Harlan makes a mental note to apologize to Bandi.

Not missing a beat, Tannin takes the momentary pause in the tavern fight to shout at his friends.

“Guys, check this out!”

He makes a swift beckoning motion at the puddle of water he spilled, and it juts out into a solid spike of ice. He kicks an orc in the chest and impales him on the icicle.

“See? It’s the perfect crime!” shouts Tannin, but the tavern battle has already resumed. 

The orc mage has cast Sphere of Silence around the tavern, rendering impossible any vocalized spells by the adventurers inside. Hermione pops outside the door to evade the Sphere. She observes Tannin and the orc impaled on an icicle and gives him a nod and a thumbs-up before summoning Sir Digs-a-Lot from his pocket dimension.

“Go, Sir Digs-a-Lot, go!” she says. “Distract one of them!” The fuzzy little creature grabs ahold of an orc foot and starts climbing up an orc leg, interrupting an orc spell in progress. “Good work!” says Hermione. She then casts Ray of Sickness on the orc mage, who clutches his stomach and sways.

Galadriel smashes through a window to evade the Sphere of Silence as well. Down the street, two orcs are still guarding what appears to be a prisoner in a cage. Under her breath, she casts Minor Illusion, and the appearance of a fire breaks out inside the cage. The guards start hacking at the lock with their axes, and in short order, they have released a very tiny wizard man from inside. 

“Is that Rompit?” Galadriel yells to Hermione.

“No!” Hermione yells back. “Too old! Much longer beard! Different gnome!”

Harlan and Hanamir take down the last orc who was foolhardy enough to charge into the tavern and join Galadriel, Hermione, and Tannin on the street. 

“Enough,” says the leader of the orcs. He turns to Hanamir and speaks in Orcish. “What business do you have in the City of the Dead?”

“I could ask you the same thing,” says Hanamir.

The orc leader gives him a once-over.

“Perhaps we’re here for the same reason,” he says.

“Tell me more, brother,” says Hanamir.

“Were you the ones who killed [Cazna](/characters/cazna/)?” The orc leader’s lips stretch into what could be a smile or a grimace. 

“I’ve done a lot of things,” says Hanamir. The rest of the adventurers listen on, understanding nothing, though Hermione nods along with the conversation.

“I took a semester of Orcish in undergrad,” whispers Hermione. 

“If you’re willing to truce with us, we’ll let you go. We’ll even let your barbarian friend go. You can leave the way you came,” says the orc leader. “We don’t want any more trouble with you. Cazna’s death was a setback, but it was… deserved.”

“You’re tellin’ me!” Hanamir chuckles. Galadriel hears the name ‘Cazna’ and gives Harlan a worried look. “Well, sounds like a deal, brother. We’ll take the gnome, we’ll take the dwarf, and we’ll be on our way.”

“Hold up,” says the orc leader. “That’s not the deal. The gnome is our way out of here. We’re not giving him up.”

Hanamir’s face remains frozen in its friendly expression, only blinking. He says nothing.

“You’re the delivery boy, then, aren’t you?” the orc leader continues. “With all those books?”

“You could say that. What books do you mean?” says Hanamir.

The orc leader laughs shallowly.

“You don’t even know what you were carrying, do you?” 

Hanamir responds again with only his chipper blinking and unnerving silence. 

“Hey, we’ll sweeten the deal, how about that? After all, you’re the only reason we got in here in the first place,” says the orc leader. He points at Hermione. “Give us back our other prisoner, the blue-haired elf, and you’ll get five hundred gold for your trouble.”

“Wait, what?” says Hermione.

“Deal,” says Hanamir. He turns to Hermione and winks at her. In an instant, he has cast Minor Illusion to camouflage the real Hermione and conjure a spectral Hermione in her place. He nudges the apparition toward the orcs. “Go on, back you go, you… silly elf, you.”

The remaining orcs congregate around the leader and prepare another set of shackles. Harlan takes the opportunity to cast Thunderwave on the group of them. Two fall over, dead.

“Wow! Heck of a storm today!” quips Hanamir. “Never mind that, here comes your prisoner!” His ghostly facsimile of Hermione starts to do a slightly silly walk toward the group of orcs, and they finally catch on to the scam. 

“All right, clear ‘em out,” growls the orc leader to his remaining soldiers. 

An all-out melee begins in the street outside the tavern. The bat riders rain darts down on Tannin. Hanamir and Harlan each take swings at a tall green orc with skin like extra-bubbly pizza crust. Galadriel shoots a spray of arrows at the mage. Hermione conjures a web and ensnares the two closest orcs. Tannin throws a javelin clean through one of them.

The other one, the green guy with the painful-looking boils, breaks free. And then it happens—the next few moments unspooling faster and faster like the last of a tightly coiled rope. 

Hanamir throws a dart at the orc with the skin condition—it hits. A massive pustule on the orc’s back erupts, drenching Harlan, Galadriel, and Sir Digs-a-Lot in a viscous layer of putrid goo—Sir Digs-a-Lot disintegrates before their eyes—Hermione cries “NOOOOOO!”—Galadriel’s skin makes a sizzling sound, but she is mostly spared, and she skitters away—and Harlan falls to his knees, seeming to melt, *Raiders of the Lost Ark*-style, in the flesh-liquefying orc zit fluid.

Before his skin is fully the texture of gak, Harlan gropes around for the satchel he keeps tied at his hip and finds the Bread of Eternal Hunger. He plunges his left hand into the bag, hoping for a merciful end to this torment, no matter the evil god who might grant it to him. But instead, he lets out an agonized scream.

*“AUGHGHGH!”*

Harlan pulls away his arm from the bag to reveal a jagged stump, a handless wrist, spurting alarming quantities of blood. He collapses to the ground in a semisolid heap.

The God of Hunger, at last, has eaten his fill.
