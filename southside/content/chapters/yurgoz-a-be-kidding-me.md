It’s dark in the dungeon except for the suggestion of a flickering torch somewhere down the narrow stone corridor.

Has it been an hour? Three hours? Eight minutes? [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) already finds it difficult to tell. She’s developed a few half-baked theories about the nature of this place, though: 

*Time behaves differently here, stretching out more and more slowly as it passes.* 

And:

*The creatures here have evolved to cope with extreme variations in pressure and gravity, and I have not, and that’s why I feel so ill.* 

But so far, she’s been unable to come up with a theory that explains how she was stupid enough to wind up here.

It was a snap decision. There were fifteen, maybe twenty seconds between the time that the clown took the tuning fork from his pocket and the moment she grabbed his hand. She should have abandoned the plan then and there—it was clear he knew she wasn’t a rich art collector. She should have called over to [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) for help. 

Would her friends have to use the quiznos, now, to come find her? They aren’t even sure it’s safe to use. What, she wonders, would the party be able to accomplish if they weren’t constantly having to rescue her from her own mistakes?

Of course, there’s a way for her to escape and not involve them at all. Her hand reaches up toward the delicate silver chain around her neck and to the pendant that hangs from it, concealed beneath the fabric of her shirt. She hasn’t risked even the thought of using the Pendant of [Eilistraee](/characters/eilistraee/)’s Wish until now, but it seems like it may be her only option, depending on what happens when the clown comes back to check on her. 

What a shame, though, to use it for something like this—to correct a stupid mistake—rather than to gain a critical advantage over a foe like the Lich...

As she mentally kicks herself once again, the tiniest movement draws her attention from the corner of her eye. It’s a spider, no more than a quarter inch, feather gray, and climbing steadily up the wall of the cell.

“Hello!” Galadriel hisses at it, suddenly on her knees with her face pressed up against the grimy stone next to the creature. “Hi, friend!” She holds up her gauntleted wrist and points at it. “Do you like this? See? I’m affiliated with the drow spider goddess, Lolth.”

The spider continues its ascent, making no indication of understanding.

“Wait, you’re not [Cazna](/characters/cazna/), are you?” Galadriel pulls back. Her vision, she notices, no longer has the faint blurry ring around her periphery that evidenced Cazna’s espionage. “Did you come here with me, then? Did you get knocked out of my eyes when we shifted to this plane?”

The spider says nothing.

“If I cast Tasha’s Hideous Laughter on you, and you laugh, then you must be something other than an ordinary spider,” she murmurs.

She does. The spell finds no target, but reverberates off the wall and bounces back at her, causing a brief giggling fit.


“Ah, well,” says Galadriel, wiping her eyes after a last sighing laugh. “I’m going to call you Charlotte.”

[Harlan](/characters/harlan/), [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/), Tannin, and [Chunk](/characters/chunk/) flee across the dark pasture. The grass is wet with nighttime frost, and by the time they’ve cleared the fog cloud, they’re each covered in a cold sheen of condensation. The Bag of Holding thumps ominously against Tannin’s back with each stride he takes across the meadow toward the stables. It gives no sign that a living prisoner is contained inside it.

“There’s an anti-magic obelisk up here,” says Harlan. He points ahead, past the stables, toward a familiar quartz structure. 

“Perfect,” says Tannin. “I hate to say it, but this guy was killing us in that fight. Did you see what he did to Hanamir?”

Hanamir grimaces, and nods.

“Yes, let’s see what he has to say for himself without the aid of his spellcasting prowess,” he says.

“How long’ll he last inside that bag, anyhow?” asks Chunk. “Can he breathe?”

“I don’t know, but I’ve heard no one’s survived in one past ten minutes,” says Harlan. He slows his pace as they approach the obelisk. “And I think upwards of seven will really change a person for life. You know... mentally.”

“So why not let him die in there, and then do Speak With Dead again to get some info from him after the fact?” Chunk proposes, boldly, and without a hint of internal conflict.

“Naaaaah.” Tannin shakes his head. “I love slaying worthy foes in battle, but not like this.”

“The obelisk should do just fine,” says Hanamir. “Tannin, if you would summon him from the Bag of Holding, please? Harlan and Chunk, be ready to hold his shackles so he can’t escape.”

When the Bag of Holding spits out the black and white clown onto the grass, the adventurers think something might have gone wrong. The clown’s robes are the same, if singed from Chunk’s lightning attack, but his head is… different. Furry. He gasps, gulping in the night air like 
water, and lifts his head. The man they captured, it seems, was not a man at all. Under the influence of the obelisk, his true form is clear.

“What’s this? Some kind of… fox man?” says Tannin. He turns to Chunk. “You know what this is, country boy?”

“Nothing I recognize,” says Chunk, scratching his head. “Aw, look, he’s even got a tail.”

“Yes, we’re calling him Tails for now,” says Harlan decisively. “Unless he’d like to provide us with his actual name…?”

The fox man glowers, but says nothing. Tannin gets up close, brandishing his trident.

“Listen,” he says. “Your disguise is off. Your magic won’t work. We don’t wanna be here; you don’t wanna be here. Tell us what happened to our friend and we’ll let you go.”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Tails hisses. His eyes dart left and right, trying to get a sense of his bearings after being stuck in the Bag of Holding. He makes a sudden break for it, but Harlan’s grip on his shackles is too strong, and he falls over on the damp grass, snarling.

“If my colleague got to your friend, I can help you get to where she’d probably be,” he spits. “But you have to let me use magic.”

“Why don’t you tell us where you think she is first?” says Harlan. “That’d be a good start.”

“He probably took her back to my home plane,” says Tails. “The Bleak Eternity of Gehenna.”

The adventurers look at each other with amused incomprehension.

“Wouldn’t want to oversell it, I suppose,” says Hanamir. “But all right. Would you mind telling us what you were doing here tonight at this nice gala rather than being home in the Bleak Eternity?”

“We were hired by someone here,” says Tails.

“Hired to explode the city?” asks Tannin, with a fake-out jab of his trident.

“I didn’t do that,” says Tails.

“But you represent an organization?” says Harlan.

“My people serve whoever can pay,” says Tails. “This is my first time on this plane. I was instructed to come tonight by my superiors.”

“And who paid?” says Harlan.

“I don’t know who they are. But their resources seem limitless, based on what they were willing to offer.”

“How much to outbid your employer?” says Hanamir.

“You don’t look like you have what I want,” smirks Tails. “We value power, whether it be in secrets or in peculiar objects, far more than we value gold. If you happen to have anything like that, perhaps you can trade it for my services. I can get your friend back from Gehenna.”

The fox man peers with some interest at the four adventurers. Tannin shrugs and summons the Balance of Harmony from the Bag of Holding.

“Do you want this?” he says, placing it at the fox man’s feet. “This set of magical scales?”

“What does it do?” 

“Dunno,” says Tannin. “I think it detects Evil and Good, or something?”

“Hm,” says Tails. “What else you got?”

“Before we offer you anything else, can we be clear on what we’re trading for?” says Harlan. “We want information about the people who hired you. And we want you to bring back our friend from wherever your colleague took her.”

“I don’t know much about my employers on this plane. But I can get your friend back. We can draw up a contract, in fact,” says Tails. He rummages in his pocket for a scroll of parchment and a pen and begins taking notes. Harlan loosens his grip on the shackles to facilitate this.

“All right, we can also give you the Bread of Eternal Hunger,” says Tannin. “Would that be enough?”

“Ooh. From Laogzed, the Trogoldyte God of Hunger? Yes, I think,” says Tails. He jots this down. “What’s in that flask?”

“Some goop that suffocates people,” says Harlan.

“Ah, you can keep it,” says Tails.

“Oh, and we want her back *alive*,” says Tannin. 

The fox man smiles devilishly.

“I'll take the goop, then,” he says.

“...and so that’s when he revealed he was a dragon all along, and he was just *disguised* as a pig!” 

Galadriel pauses in her tale. Charlotte, the spider, doesn’t seem to find this part of the story as revelatory and exciting as she’d hoped. She’s had to divert Charlotte’s path along the wall manually a few times in order to keep her audience.

“All right,” she sighs. “I can tell you’re not interested. And you’re not Cazna in disguise, either. So how’d you get here, then?”

A sound like a blade being unsheathed rings out down the narrow corridor beyond her cell. There’s some clicking—and some foreign, horrible noise, like low-pitched shrieking—and then the heavy thud of a body falling to the floor. 

Two of the bug creatures appear at the door of her cell seconds later. 

“Uh,” says Galadriel, “what just happened? Did you kill someone?”

One of the bug creatures makes an unintelligible sound from the region she supposes is its mouth. It unlocks her cell and swings the door open, rusty and loud.

*Come with me.* 

This thought appears in her head in a way that is reminiscent of, but not the same as, the way [Buddy](/characters/buddy/) communicates telepathically with her. 

“Who are you?” says Galadriel.

The bug creature merely prods her with the tines of his forked weapon in response. 

“All right then,” says Galadriel. She scoops Charlotte off the wall and tucks her into her pocket.

The two bug creatures march her down the hallway toward the source of the flickering torchlight. She sees the gooey remains of the person who’d apparently had a scuffle minutes ago. There’s not much of him left, she notes with disgust. 

At that moment, the bug creature that holds her left arm falls to the ground, clicking and shrieking and, immediately, melting into the same liquid.

“Is he okay?!” she yelps, looking back and forth between the pile of goo next to her and the bug creature on the right. The bug creature on the right seems completely cool with the death of his comrade, until he, too, begins this noisy and gross process of bug death.

Galadriel whips her head around, but sees no one.

“Hello?”

*Your friends sent me.*

It’s a different voice, and it apparently belongs to a cloaked creature with a furry face who has a fistful of deadly-looking darts in one hand and a shortsword in the other. He emerges from around a corner and sheathes the sword.

“Who are you? What’s your name?”

*My name is Yurgoz.*

Galadriel has the sense, somehow, that this word is only comprehensible on this plane.

“If I come with you, where are you taking m—”

*We don’t have time for chit-chat.*

The fox man grabs her hand, and she feels the same flattening and pasta-making sensation she felt not long ago, but in reverse, and then she feels a cool night breeze against her face.

She’s standing on a rooftop over a dark and bustling city that she recognizes as Aberith.

“Yes!” she cries.

She spider-climbs down the side of the building. She’s not far from Silver Hill, she realizes. She can get back to the gala, if it’s still happening.

“Thank you, fox man!” she calls behind her, though she can’t see him.

---

The boys, upon unshackling the fox man and watching him disappear into a swirling portal a few yards away from the obelisk, look at each other in silence.

“I hope that was the right call,” says Harlan, after a moment. “I hope that contract was… binding.”

“Yeah, I’ll be pissed if we gave away the Bread of Eternal Hunger for nothing,” says Tannin. He pounds his recently-regenerated fist into his other palm.

“Why don’t we head back to the gala?” says Hanamir. “We should thank [Goldpeak](/characters/goldpeak/) for holding up his end of the bargain.”

They trudge back across the meadow toward Goldpeak’s lesser mansion. The fog cloud Harlan conjured by the door from the garden to the ballroom is mostly dissipated, but a chilly humidity still rests over the area. As they approach, they can hear Goldpeak yelling indistinctly from inside the ballroom.

“Uh oh,” says Chunk. “He doesn’t sound happy.”

Indeed, he is not.

“What did I tell you?!” he roars, directing his brick-faced rage in Harlan’s direction. “I told you to make sure she left! I told you she was a thief!”

Servants in gold velvet uniforms are tending to several frames containing nothing but tattered canvas edges. The paintings inside, apparently, have been cut out and stolen.

“Wasn’t ‘Argentum Blunderbuss’ your pseudonym, Harlan?” asks Hanamir. He’s pointing at a notecard left on the table where Harlan and Lady Platernia shared their brief conversation. It is propped up against a single rose with petals so dark red they appear almost black.

*For Mr. Blunderbuss. It was a pleasure to meet you.* 

Harlan turns the note over, expecting some kind of contact information, but there is none. 

"And *three* of my priceless eggs—gold inlaid with gemstones—were stolen," Goldpeak continues. His voice is becoming hoarse.

"We will do what we can to address this," says Harlan blankly. His surprise has overtaken his need to understand further. 

At that moment, Galadriel bursts through the door from the garden.  

"You guys..." she begins, with heaving breaths, "are never gonna believe... where I just was..."

When she puts a hand over her chest to steady herself, she notices that something is missing. Something important. The Pendant of Eilistraee's Wish is gone.

And then, as if punctuating the evening's bad news, Galadriel vanishes from where she stands in the doorway.
