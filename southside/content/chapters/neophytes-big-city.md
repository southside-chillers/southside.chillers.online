The next day, the road to Aberith becomes gritty with sand. The adventurers can hear the sound of seagulls in the distance, but the ocean is still out of sight. They have reached the edge of a coastal farming town in the grassy lowlands. A few hulking, horned creatures can be seen grazing to the side of their path. 

“I can’t tell if that barn up ahead is oversized, or if I’m just feeling insignificant,” says [Harlan](/characters/harlan/), squinting.

“Oversized, I think,” says [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/). “For scale, I spy a certain blue-haired elf.”

He’s right: emerging beside the barn, [Hermione](/characters/hermione/) is pacing in a circle, scribbling notes in her logbook with characteristic intensity. When they are close enough to her to get her attention, she looks up and smiles.

“I thought you all might catch up to me here,” she says. “I couldn’t help but stop and observe the aurochs.”

[Tannin](/characters/tannin/) drops the tattered bedroll at her feet. 

“Observe this!” he says proudly. 

“Uh,” says Hermione. “What?”

“We killed a basilisk,” says Harlan. 

“What?!” Hermione yelps, kneeling down and starting to unwrap the reptilian corpse from the bedding. “I missed a basilisk?!”

The other adventurers cringe and shield their eyes.

“Oh, you can look,” says Hermione. “Once it’s dead, it can’t hurt you. Unless you know how to prepare potions from its organs.”

“Do you?” asks Hanamir.

“Sadly, no,” says Hermione. “But I’m sure someone in the city does.” She strokes the basilisk’s spiny face and sighs. “I’ve always wanted to encounter one of these in the wild.”

Tannin re-packages the basilisk into the bedroll and tosses it over his shoulder again. 

“So, while you were observing the aurochs,” says Harlan, “did you find out why the buildings around here are so big?”

“Large, blue humanoids live here,” says Hermione. “Eight to ten feet tall, pointy ears. I don’t know what they’re called, and thought it might be rude to ask.”

“Probably a good instinct,” says Hanamir. 

They continue on through the community and see the blue people attending to their morning farm chores. As they walk, a foreign thought appears in [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/)’s mind.

GALADRIEL, HEY.

Even though it’s no longer new or surprising, Galadriel still feels her heartbeat accelerate.

*[Buddy](/characters/buddy/)! What’s up?*

I DON’T THINK I SHOULD GO TO ABERITH. 

Galadriel tries to hide her disappointment. She’d been afraid of this—the moment when Buddy would decide he’d had enough of her, and would leave, and go off to do far more interesting things, and would forget about her within a year or two of his next century of life…

DON’T WORRY. IT’S NOT THAT.

She flushes.

I’M CONCERNED THAT THERE MAY BE PEOPLE IN THE CITY WHO ARE ABLE TO TELL WHAT I AM.

*Okay*, thinks Galadriel. *So do you want to stay here in town while we go to Aberith?*

YES. MAYBE YOU COULD FIND A FARMER WITH SOME EXTRA SPACE IN HIS STABLE FOR ME AND THE GIANT BAT?

*Oh man… farmers and pigs, though? I don’t know. What if someone tries to eat you?*

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. THEY COULD TRY! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

*All right. I know I promised not to worry about you.* 

YOU DID. I’LL BE FINE. LOOK AT ME.

Galadriel glances down and sees Buddy give her an exaggerated wink. She can’t help but smile. 

“Harlan,” says Galadriel. “What do you think of asking that farmer up ahead if he’d care for Zotz and Buddy while we’re in the city?”

“Good idea,” says Harlan. “I doubt it’s practical to fly a giant bat through the streets of Aberith. But... Buddy? You’re not bringing him with you?”

“No,” she says, without elaborating.

“Hmm,” says Harlan. He gives her some side-eye. “Okay.”

They approach a tall, pointy-eared, blue-skinned individual wearing a straw hat. He is brushing the coat of an auroch and patting its head.

“Good morning, sir,” Harlan addresses him.

“Oh, hey there,” says the blue man in a charming drawl. “Name’s Elris. Nice to meet y’all. Never seen a bat that big before.”

“Yes, this is Camazotz,” says Harlan. “I won him through conquest and now he’s my trusty steed of the air.”

“Mighty fine bat there, indeed.” Elris nods appreciatively.

“We were wondering if you might have any room in your stable to look after my bat, as well as this little pig, for a few days while we visit Aberith,” says Harlan.

“Certainly, certainly, I’d be happy to take care of your critters,” Elris says. “Only problem is that the city right now—well, they’re not really letting people in.”

“Is that so?” asks Hermione.

“Yes, ma’am. I’m afraid only people with official business are going in right now. There’s been a rash of crime going on in the city. All y’all might be stayin’ out here for a spell.”

“Well, we do have business with the king…” starts Harlan.

“Business with the king?!” The farmer is shocked, but still speaks at a leisurely pace. “Who might y’all be, if you don’t mind my asking?”

“Adventurers,” says Harlan. “I’m Harlan Stormborne, cleric of Kord, and these are my companions. We have an important message for King Slee from the mayor of Eillin.”

“Well, you shouldn’t have an issue if you’re acquainted with such folk,” says Elris. “I can take care of the bat and the pig for five silver a day.”

“Thank you,” says Harlan. “I’ll add another five silver on top of that just to make sure they get the best possible care.”

“Why, thanks, that’s very generous.” Elris tips his hat.

“Just to be clear,” says Galadriel, a little more sharply than she intended, “this pig is like my son.”

“That’s mighty strange, miss,” says Elris with a chuckle. “We do tend to eat these kinds of critters normally, but don’t you worry, this one will be off limits.”

“Thank you,” says Galadriel.

“And if it doesn’t work out for y’all at the border, and you find yourselves in need of a place to stay, we do run an inn here,” says Elris. 

“We appreciate the offer,” says Hermione. She pauses. “Before we go, do you have any details about the crime wave you mentioned? We want to keep ourselves safe in the city.” 

“Oh, yes,” Elris sighs. “It’s very troubling. What we hear is that there’s been a tremendous number of people disappearing.”

“That is worrisome,” says Harlan.

“I always just tell everyone to stay out of the Kiln, but we hear folks are disappearing from all over the city, not just there.”

“The Kiln?” says Hermione.

“It’s a rough neighborhood in Aberith,” says Elris. “Here, I’ve got a map on me. Y’all can take it with you, now.” He produces a wrinkled but functional street map of Aberith from a pocket in his overalls.

“Thank you, once again, sir,” says Galadriel.

“Is there a pattern to the people who have gone missing?” asks Hermione.

“I’m afraid I don’t know, miss. You could ask the guards.”

“Well, thanks again for everything,” says Harlan, extending a hand. “We’ll see you in a few days, and thank you for taking care of our animal friends.”

Elris shakes his hand and tips his hat again. 

“All right, Harlan Stormborne and company,” he says. “Travel safe, now.”

Zotz gives Harlan a farewell shriek. Galadriel stifles her sorrow at leaving Buddy behind and reminds herself it’s for his own safety. Buddy gives her a gentle headbutt in the shins and follows Elris to his stables.

---

The adventurers follow the road out of the farming village and reach the edge of the city. Beyond the wall, there are three tall towers that dominate the skyline, and the ocean glitters like a field of sapphires in the distance. 

The gate ahead is guarded by several human men in shiny armor. They look overheated, bored, and surly. One of them speaks as the party approaches.

“What business do you have in Aberith?”

“We’re here to see King Slee,” Galadriel announces.

“Oh?” says the guard. He and his compatriots laugh. “Are you a close personal friend of the king, little lady?”

“We have an important message for him from the mayor of Eillin,” she says. “The mayor is unable to deliver it himself, since that town is also on lockdown, as you know.”

“And what is the nature of your message?” says the guard. His friends have quieted down. He peers at Galadriel’s face with some surprise, as he registers that she’s serious.

“There is a grave threat from the City of the Dead,” says Harlan.

The guard turns his attention to Harlan, looking unimpressed.

“All right, well…” He glances at the other guards and shrugs. “We’re just supposed to make sure no one unsavory comes in. You guys seem fine. But if you want to see the king, you’ll have to get through another checkpoint in the north of the city, and I can’t help you there.”

“While we have you,” says Harlan, “can you tell us what’s going on in the city? With the disappearances, that is?”

“People have been going missing.” The guard shrugs again.

“Yes, but what people?” Harlan presses.

“Frankly, I don’t know why we care. Just riff raff. The council had us put these restrictions in place anyway, though.”

“Do you know who might have more details on this?” asks Hermione. “I’m a little nervous.”

“Well, if you’re going to see the king, he’d be able to tell you all the specifics,” says the guard. “Or any of the other ministers on the council. But from what I heard, it’s mostly just like… goblin kids going missing.”

“Is there a large goblin population in Aberith?” asks Galadriel.

“Larger than I’d like,” says the guard snidely. The other guards guffaw behind him.

“And where do they live?” asks Harlan.

“They’re not welcome in the north of the city, that’s for sure.” The guard pauses. “There have been some humans who’ve gone missing, too, though. So be careful, I guess.”

He opens the gate and waves them through.

They walk through a neighborhood marked on Elris’s map as Smalltree. Just as the farming village was oversized to accommodate its residents, this community is built on a much smaller scale. Halflings going about their daily errands pay little attention to the adventurers as they pass through. Tannin looks thrilled to be a head taller than almost everyone.

But given its miniature scale, Smalltree does not occupy much area, and it soon gives way to a sprawling slum labeled on the map as the Kiln. The halflings are replaced by a population of goblins, half-orcs, strung-out humans, and some cloaked figures that may be hiding the tails and horns of tieflings. 

[The Savage](/characters/the-savage/), still holding [Redyl](/characters/redyl/) in the baby bjorn on his chest, flares his nostrils with disgust as he passes a street vendor selling a variety of eyeballs. Mercifully, little old Redyl has fallen asleep with his gnome hat over much of his face. 

A few of the half-orcs nod at Hanamir as he passes. 

Hanamir addresses each one in Thieves’ Cant, which sounds oddly poetic (but nonsensical) to the ears of the other adventurers. 

“I’ve a pair of eyes to switch a gallows-green chunk of brandy,” he murmurs to a half-orc with a jagged scar on his cheek. He slips him a piece of gold. “Point me to a piece man?”

“A pigeon-plucker you’ll find at the beggar-maker’s door,” says the other half-orc, pocketing the gold. “Soon. At six dirty fingers.”

“Thanks,” says Hanamir.

The adventurers stare at him, awaiting explanation. Hanamir smiles softly. 

“Just asking about a potential buyer for our special cargo,” he says. He nods at Tannin’s bedroll-wrapped burden.

“Ohhh,” says Tannin. “Nice.”

Hanamir leads them to what must be “the beggar-maker’s door,” or an alleyway next to a disgusting tavern. In a few minutes, an individual of orcish and goblin heritage emerges from the dark recesses of the alley.

“How can I help you fine folks today,” he croaks, looking at each of them in a way that could be interpreted as threatening. Hermione looks intensely uncomfortable.

“We have come into possession of a certain item,” says Hanamir. “I understand you’re interested in items.”

“At times I have been known to purchase items, living and dead,” says the man.

“I see,” says Hanamir. He gestures to Tannin, who hands over the bedroll. “Check this out.”

The man takes a brief look under the blanket and inhales deeply.

“Mm. Fresh. I’m willing to buy this one for sixty gold, and any future ones for eighty.”

Hanamir turns to Hermione, who has been trying unsuccessfully to hide behind him.

“Does that sound reasonable to you?” he asks.

“Seems low,” she says, without making eye contact.

“How about a trade?” says Hanamir, turning back to the orc-goblin. 

“What are you looking for? Body parts? I got all kinds of body parts.” He takes another whiff of the basilisk corpse. “Listen, you know it’s dangerous to ask around about what you’ve got here, with the AMLs and all. You should take the deal.”

“AMLs?” asks Galadriel.

“The Anti-Magic League,” says the man. “You not from around here or something?”

“Just passing through,” she says.

“Well, the Minister of Trade caved to the AMLs, and it’s illegal to buy or sell magical items right now. You all ought to be careful.”

“Instead of selling you the item itself, could we pay you for your knowledge of how to use it?” asks Hanamir.

“Not my area of expertise, as it were,” says the man. “If knowledge is what you’re after, you might stop by this tavern here, the Upstanding Gentleman, after nightfall, and find someone who can tell you what you need to know.” He licks his lips. “Do we have a deal on the item here or not?”

Harlan turns and looks at them all. 

“No, right?” he says. “We can do better.”

“All right, all right, you’re too smart,” says the orc-goblin. “Two hundred and fifty gold, if you’re gonna play hardball.”

Hanamir looks tempted, but Galadriel shakes her head.

“I want more information on what exactly we can do with it first,” she says. 

“Tell you what,” says Hanamir to the man in the shadows. “I’ll come and find you tomorrow.”

“Fine,” says the man. “Good luck out there.”

---

Harlan inspects Elris’s map. 

“If we want to try and see the king, we need to head north,” he says. 

He leads them through several more cramped streets lined with illicit-seeming storefronts until they turn a corner and reach a more mainstream thoroughfare. They pass through a touristy area of souvenir shops and cafés, and then an upscale residential neighborhood labeled on the map as Rivergate. 

Past the stately riverfront properties, they come to a bridge heavily patrolled by guards in the same gleaming armor as the ones outside the city. The guards are questioning a handful of well-dressed people who are attempting to cross to the northern part of the city.

“We may not be able to get across here with the, uh, item,” mutters Hermione.

“I can stay behind. You know. With the... *asilisk-bay orpse-cay*,” says Tannin, grinning conspiratorially.

“Yeah, we know,” says Hermione. “As long as you don’t draw any attention to yourself.”

“I’ll stay behind, too!” pipes up Redyl, sounding groggy. “I don’t want any more trouble. I’m old and tired. Let me stay with Mr. Tannin.”

“Fine by me,” says the Savage. He sets Redyl down on the cobblestone street and then takes out his dagger, shredding the makeshift baby bjorn as if ridding himself of a parasitic growth. 

“All right, so the rest of us will try and cross the bridge,” says Harlan. “What’s our story here? Galadriel, do you want to take the lead?”

“Sure,” she says. “I’ll be a fancy diplomat of some kind, and you all just pretend to be my entourage of bodyguards or something.”

Harlan looks skeptical, but lets Galadriel walk ahead of him to the bridge checkpoint. She throws her shoulders back and gives her hair a good, regal-looking toss.

“Hello, good sir,” she smiles at the nearest guard. “I have arrived for my appointment with King Slee.”

“Good afternoon, madam,” says the guard, flipping through a pad of parchment. “You have an appointment with the king?”

“Yes, a standing appointment.”

The guard rummages again through his papers, then looks up at Galadriel.

“What does this appointment pertain to, madam?” 

Galadriel stares at him. The guard gets the sense, somehow, that *she* is trying to figure out what *he* is up to. 

“It’s above your paygrade,” she says, smirking. She can hear Harlan sighing and muttering something about tact behind her.

“And who are all these people accompanying you?” says the guard.

“These are my bodyguards. I feel very vulnerable in the city right now, what with all the disappearances,” she explains. “I’m sure you understand. It would be dangerous for a public figure such as myself to travel alone.”

The guard’s eyes widen with confusion.

“I’m not… I mean… we would have heard if we were supposed to let you through today, madam…” 

“You don’t recognize me?” says Galadriel, sounding amused. Behind her, Hanamir gives the guard a toothy grin.

A bead of sweat drips down the side of the guard’s face.

“Okay, look, I guess I can let you through, but we’ll have to have some guards escort you to the king,” he says.

“Oh, that’s fine,” says Galadriel, as if taking the high road. “I’m sure this is a misunderstanding. The king is expecting me.”

With spears pointed in Hanamir’s direction, a group of guards in different, amber-colored robes leads them across the bridge and into a wide, marble square with a beautiful plein-air market. It looks like a place that would usually be bustling with activity, but is now sparsely populated due to the lockdown. 

They pass by two of the tall towers visible from outside the city—the Temple of Light and the Temple of Winds, which Harlan recognizes as a temple to Kord. 

“Look at that!” he marvels, craning his neck upward. “I’ve never seen a more magnificent monument to the Lord of Storms. Praise be to Kord.”

Finally, they reach the steps of the castle. One of the guards runs up to alert the king to his visitors. In just a few minutes, he returns, and the rest of the guards lead them up the stairs and down some impressive entry halls to the king’s reception chamber.

“Friends from Eillin!” says King Slee, waving them in and dismissing the guards. “I thought it might be you.”

The adventurers bow, and the guards depart. 

“I don’t think I’m acquainted with all of you, though…?” Slee looks at Hermione.

“Yes, our adventuring party has grown, your majesty,” says Galadriel. “This is Hermione, a very learned scholar of magical creatures. And another of our friends, Tannin, awaits us outside. You will surely meet him someday.”

“Pleasure to meet you, Hermione,” says the king. “Do come inside.”

He leads them from the reception chamber to a smaller room, a parlor, where a sharply-dressed man sits on an embroidered chaise, smoking a pipe.

“I hope you all will excuse me,” says Slee, as if he somehow should have known they’d drop by unannounced. “One of my ministers is here, meeting with me. I feel anything you might need to share with me can be shared with him as well.”

“Hello,” says the man with the pipe. “I am Ultas Kandir, the Minister of Trade.”

The adventurers are suddenly tongue-tied. 

“Your highness,” says Hermione delicately, “would it be appropriate to discuss matters of garbanzos, kidneys, and limas?”

The king looks amused, and the Minister of Trade chuckles.

“I’m well aware of the Order of the Been, if that’s what you mean,” says Kandir.

“Well, we just came from Eillin,” says Harlan. “Rather, the Eillin border, where we were able to speak briefly with Mayor Thunderstruck. We told him, and now must tell you, that the Lich is amassing power within the City of the Dead, and is allied with [Khargol](/characters/khargol/) and his orcs with the goal of killing one or more gods, and of loosing his undead upon the continent.”

Slee furrows his brow, but the trade minister speaks up first.

“And how, pray tell, would the Lich escape? He’s been sealed in for centuries,” says Kandir. “If that’s all you came to say, I would ask you to please allow me to continue my meeting with the king.”

“If you were really familiar with the Order of the Been, you’d know it’s very possible for him to escape,” says Hermione. “And it’s disconcerting if you do know that and you’re not willing to listen.”

“Speaking of being familiar with the Order,” says the Savage. “I wonder if the only two actual members of this *secret order* present might be allowed some time to chat alone. About *secret order* business.”

“Of course, old friend,” Slee says warmly. “It’s been far too long, Savage. I had hoped I’d see you at—”

“Yes, the Moon Festival,” sighs the Savage. “As I have explained to these tryhards, I was away on important business to protect Eillin, and couldn’t make it to the party.”

“Sorry, but no, you weren’t,” snaps Galadriel. “You were possessed by the Lich and were under his control until we showed up and freed you. So you’ll include us in your secrets from now on.”

“Possessed by the Lich?” says Slee, suddenly pale. “Savage, is this true?”

“It’s impossible,” Kandir butts in. “And if this is all about Eillin—an uncultured backwater town with no real government to speak of—I implore you, your majesty, to waste no more of your time with these people and to return to more important city matters with me.”

“Aberith has pledged itself to protect Eillin,” says Slee. “Kandir, I beg your patience. I must hear them out.”

“The Lich possessed the Savage outside the City of the Dead,” says Harlan. “His direct influence can extend beyond its walls.” The Savage looks down at the floor, which Slee, horrified, takes for confirmation. “Further, we know that he was trying to recruit Khargol’s army of orcs to do his bidding. If he’s recruiting minions to do his ill works, that is a concern to the entire kingdom, not just Eillin.”

“We beg for your assistance, with knowledge or other resources, in addressing this threat,” says Galadriel. 

“I don’t have much knowledge,” says King Slee. “Bryn and Uncle sealed the city. For that, we are all grateful. There haven’t been any undead sightings since then. If what you say is true, I would expect to have heard of *something*, rumors, at least, of their reappearance…”

“The undead have not ventured outside the city yet, as far as we know,” says Hermione. “But we have seen the orcs inside, entering via coercion of magic users who can plane-shift them through the Shadowfell.”

“This is very troubling,” says Slee.

“We’re going after the Lich,” says Hanamir. “Our goal is to defeat him. Any knowledge about how best to fight him would be a gift not only to us, but to all of your people.”

“I understand, and I will support you however I can,” says the king. “I will write you passes to the royal library, which you may browse at your leisure...”

Hermione and Hanamir look at each other, ecstatic.

“...And I will also grant you passes to move freely through the city checkpoints.”

“Thank you, your highness,” says Harlan, sinking into a deep bow.

“The laws will still apply to you. I expect you not to cause any trouble in the city, or I’ll have to revoke your privileges. That includes the ban on buying and selling magical items.”

“Understood,” says Harlan.

“May we ask the cause of the ban, your majesty?” asks Hanamir.

“Oh, well,” the king says, sounding tired. “Pressure from the AML, mostly. Since all the disappearances, they’ve been much more active. They keep spreading false reports of ridiculous sightings—ten dragons rampaging through the city, you get the picture—and we had to do something to calm everyone down. The ban seems to satisfy them for now.”

Trade Minister Kandir is slumped on the chaise, looking bored out of his mind. He drums his fingers on his knee.

“Are you done—” he starts, but the Savage interrupts.

“Slee,” he says. “I really do need to speak to you alone.”

“No,” says Galadriel. “No more of that from you. You cannot hold out on us now. We’ve proven ourselves to be working toward the same goal as you.”

“Sir,” says the Savage.

“You still have gaps in your memory!” cries Galadriel. “And you still look old, for reasons you can’t explain—”

“Old?” says the king. 

The adventurers all exchange confused looks.

“Unless... your youth was the disguise,” murmurs Hanamir. 

The Savage is apoplectic. 

“Very well,” he spits. “Slee, I request command of a portion of your troops. We need to drive out the orcs. All of them, across the entire continent.”

The king looks at him in silence.

“This is the way for me to uphold my oath. They need to be gone. Whatever this rift is between factions of orcs—the Shargaasians and the Gruumsh loyalists—we can exploit it. I have already killed Khargol; his men are leaderless. The time is now.”

“Savage,” says the king, sounding wearier than ever, “the time cannot be now. Not in the middle of everything else that’s going on. We cannot raise another army and start a war.” He takes a moment to think. “I will grant you an audience with the council in a few days’ time, but until then, I ask that you stand down. We must table the issue.”

The energy in the room has dwindled, and the king looks finally ready to resume his prior meeting. The adventurers thank him for his time and are escorted out by the same group of guards as before. Galadriel makes eye contact with the one who doubted her.

“Thank you, dear,” she says, with a benevolent smile. “Lead the way, now, if you would.”
