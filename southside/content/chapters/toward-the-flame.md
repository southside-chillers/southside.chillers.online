It's another beautiful day in the town of Eillin. [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) is still on his personal side quest, but [Harlan](/characters/harlan/), [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/), and [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) are eager to solve the problem of the burning forest, and they're running out of time before the Moon Festival. Their only choice is to press on.

They return to [Bryn](/characters/bryn/)'s observatory for some information before they leave town. Galadriel hands him the enchanted gauntlet and asks if he knows anything about it. "Where did you get this?" Bryn asks, concerned. "The symbol of Lolth is most unwelcome in town." He reminds them that Lolth, the spider goddess, once had many followers in Eilistraee, but they were driven out. Galadriel asks him if he can detect any curses on the gauntlet. "It would be a curse to wear it here," he replies.

They ask him what to expect if they succeed in viewing the moon with the red glass goggles. His theory, he says, is that the moon has been cut in two. If this is the case, it would be a sign that something deeply wrong has happened to Eilistraee, and the town would need to evacuate.

The team lets him know that the orcs they've encountered have claimed responsibility via their god, Shargaas, for the threat to the moon. "Shargaas?!" Bryn exclaims, with a pointed look toward Hanamir. 

"My only god is the written word," says Hanamir. "But there is an orc temple to Shargaas not far from here, according to [the Savage](/characters/the-savage/)."

"Oh! He's around? I'm surprised he hasn't made himself known," says Bryn, his tone changing. "The Savage is an old friend of the town. I haven't seen him since I was a boy, but he's a famous warrior. Utterly devoted to the pursuit of valor. He's saved us from more than one disaster in the past." Bryn considers this, and frowns. "I know not if his presence now be an omen of good or ill."

The party thanks Bryn for his insight and returns to the inn, in the hopes of running into Mayor [Frunk](/characters/frunk/). They suspect that the Mayor might be able to tell them more. Fleck the bartender greets them with a twinkle in his gold-coin eyes. Sure enough, among the surviving townsfolk, Mayor Frunk sits in his familiar spot at the bar.

"The Savage? Sure I know him. He just left the inn, in fact," says Frunk. "The man's an inspiration. He was born here, and though he travels far and wide, he always comes back when we need him. You won't believe this, but when he was just sixteen, he slew a dragon."

"Is he still in town? What's he doing here?" asks Harlan. 

"He said he had to check on something, and then he was on his way. Didn't waste time leaving."

"Hey, you wouldn't happen to know anything about a man who went by 'Uncle', would you?" says Galadriel.

Frunk doesn't know why, but he feels comfortable sharing, though he usually wouldn't. "Oh, yes. He was known as Uncle because I called him that first. I don't know his real name. He was like an uncle to me."

"Did Uncle and the Savage know each other?" Galadriel says, sensing she may be pushing her luck.

"Um, they might have," says Frunk. "But uh, sorry, the King is coming into town for the Moon Festival and I really need to go prepare for that. Get... supplies. King stuff. Stuff that kings like."

Hanamir stealthily watches where Frunk goes when he leaves. It appears he's headed to the house of [H'Jun](/characters/hjun/)—his friend who was robbed of the eel brain during the first chapter of this quest.

Our heroes strike out for the burning forest. Hanamir wears the red glass goggles, leading the pack. Galadriel puts on the gauntlet of Lolth, hoping that the blindsight and climbing ability will come in handy. Harlan can't see through the smoke, but he hangs back with Galadriel. 

With the goggles, Hanamir senses that a wall of fire in their path is actually fake, and leads them through it. They come to a pond, which has effectively sheltered its surrounding trees from the fire. Galadriel tests out her new spiderlike climbing skills by quickly scaling a tree and surveying their options. There's a fork in the path ahead, and to the left there is a hut, untouched by fire. To the right, she sees nothing but dense woods, and the suggestion of faint movement within.

They go left and investigate the hut. Hanamir tries to sneak through the door, but stumbles on his way in, surprising an elderly tiefling inside. The tiefling reaches for a trident. "Oops, pardon me," says Hanamir. 

"How did you get in here?" says the tiefling. "I haven't seen anyone in ages! The fire's driven everyone away. I can't even get out. I'm so lonely! The name's [Magick](/characters/magick/), by the way. I make potions. Healing potions, potions that'll make you impervious to magic, all kinds of potions. I'm even working on one that lets you plane shift at will, but so far all it does is bring me back to the center of my hut.  I have a lot of it, if you guys want some. You'll have to let me know how it affects each of you, being different types of creatures than little ol' me." They each accept a vial of the plane shifting potion, just in case it comes in handy later. "I can sell you some of the other potions, but I only take electrum. No interest in gold. Or I'll barter you for 'em. Do you have anything I could wear that might make me feel fancy? That would keep me from being bored for a good couple of days, I think."

The party inspects their inventory, but they don't have anything that would fit the bill for fanciness. 

"I hear rope can be considered a fancy accessory in some cultures," Hanamir suggests. 

"Oh... no thanks," says Magick, looking put out. 

"What if we show you the way out of the forest in exchange for three vials of your magic imperviousness potion?" Harlan asks, ever the bargain hunter.

"Sounds good!" says Magick.

As they lead the tiefling out of the forest, past the fake fire, they try to glean more information about their surroundings.

"Do you know who is in the tower?" asks Hanamir. 

"No one, I suspect," says Magick. "Once the red dragon set this fire, it went back to sleep, I think. No one left in the forest now except for me and old Grizzleby. That's the dragon's name. It's a very common dragon name."

They bid the tiefling farewell and return down the left-side fork in the path, past the hut this time. They come to a rocky clearing that leads to a cave. There is a great heat emanating from the cave, and it looks unnaturally dark inside. Galadriel, using the gauntlet's blindsight, peers inside. "It looks great in here!" she says. "Lots of spider webs. Tons of them on all the walls. I am feeling really good about exploring in here."

Hanamir lights a torch, catching the attention of two giant spiders inside. The first one approaches him and tries to bite him, but he dodges. The second one shoots a web, Spider-Man-style, at Galadriel, but she jumps out of the way. "Friends, fear not!" Galadriel addresses the spiders and displays the insignia on her gauntlet. "I come in the name of Lolth!"

The second spider pauses a moment, then shoots another web at her, binding her to the wall. Galadriel is trapped and indignant.

Hanamir attacks the first spider with his shortsword and misses. Harlan follows up with his maul, and makes a solid hit. At that point, two much smaller spiders—about fist-sized—scurry in from the deeper part of the cave. They try to bite Harlan, but he swats them away. The first spider takes advantage of his distraction and successfully attacks him. Harlan hits back with Wrath of the Storm, bloodying the spider. 

The second spider rounds on Hanamir and bites him with its huge pincers. He's not poisoned, but he sustains heavy damage. Meanwhile, Galadriel struggles to free herself from the web, but is so ineffective at doing so that she sprains her wrist. Still, she can at least help by healing Hanamir from across the cave. Hanamir then casts the fatal blow to the first spider. 

Harlan swings at the second spider with his maul but misses. The two smaller spiders creep up on still-stuck Galadriel and start biting her. Galadriel tries to free herself _again_ and fails _again_. There's a bloody back-and-forth between Hanamir, Harlan, and the remaining giant spider, while the smaller spiders focus on nibbling Galadriel. The giant spider is wounded, and after one last attempt at biting Harlan, it flees to the back of the cave. Harlan and Hanamir try to hit it with their ranged weapons, but it gets away, disappearing into a crevice similar to the one they saw in their last spider battle.

Galadriel tries a third time to escape the web and damages herself doing so. It's a bad scene. Hanamir and Harlan come over and each squash one of the smaller spiders. Hanamir then uses his torch to free Galadriel, who is a bit embarrassed, but still in a weirdly good mood.

They explore the cave. There are silk-wrapped shapes in various stages of being eaten, but none of them appear to be humanoid this time around. There are 200-300 spider eggs.

Galadriel climbs up the walls and hangs out on the ceiling. She is loving the abilities the gauntlet has given her! She feels so alive, so agile, so arachnoid! 

"I feel VERY good and normal!" she shouts down at her compatriots. 

"Hmm. What happens if you take off the gauntlet, Galadriel?" says Hanamir. She tries, but cannot. It is fused with her arm.

"So what do you think?" says Harlan. "Should we take some spider eggs? Or just burn the whole thing?" Galadriel jumps down from the ceiling and claws at his eyes.

After that scuffle subsides, they leave the cave, and Galadriel feels suddenly able to share with them that there were no fewer than 900 other spiders hiding deeper in the cave. The gauntlet prevented her from saying this. She realizes it would take a priest of Lolth to remove the gauntlet from her arm, and if they encounter any more spiders in the forest, she might unintentionally take their side. They try to exit the forest the way they came, but they find that the fake fire is now real—they are trapped. 

There is no choice but to venture onward toward the tower and hope the bonds of their friendship can withstand the sinister forces that surround them.
