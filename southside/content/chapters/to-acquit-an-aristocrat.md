# The heist

Per [Mirama](/characters/mirama/)’s request, we are going to infiltrate Goldpeak’s mansion. We're looking for info that might exonerate him, or at least shed more light on his financial dealings that make him public enemy number one. 

There are a handful of guards posted around the grounds, making sure no one messes with the crime scene. We’re familiar enough with this outside area; in [Chapter 48](/chapters/partys-over/), we exited the gala through the garden behind the ballroom. In front, there’s a fountain and a path to the main entrance. The house is three stories tall. We really only know the layout of the first floor—it has a ballroom, a kitchen, and another room we didn’t see.

[Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) goes out front to distract the guards while the rest sneak in through the garden in back. She decides to say she’s doing a tribute concert for first responders, in thanks for tracking down the culprits in the terrible Flats explosion attack. 

[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) casts Pass Without Trace, facilitating a successful group sneak around the back of the mansion. There are two guards posted in the rear near the gardens, but they pose no problem. 

Galadriel's performance is entertaining enough to the set of guards posted in front.

- She performs a song with lyrics that include, “I’m proud to be an Aberithian, where at least I know I’m free.” 
- This is a boring job, so they’re okay with this. 
- She asks if there are any other guards who might appreciate a serenade. They say there are two more around the back, and that a few more will be here in a little while when their shift changes.
- She asks if she can stick around to wait for them, and they're cool with it, though they think it’s kind of weird.

The others go straight to the ballroom and have no issues getting in. The ballroom seems undisturbed by the investigation. They proceed next into the unknown room, which is being used for storage. They see:

- a piano
- some crates
- some unidentified shapes covered by canvas cloths

[Chunk](/characters/chunk/) turns into a cat to be as stealthy as possible, and leads the way upstairs. They proceed into the study, where they see:

- a desk, with drawers
- some chairs

There is nothing on the desk, so they check the drawers and find:

- a few financial documents describing the sale of several artifacts. It's not clear what they are, but seems like some kind of rare art. 
- But importantly... the sale is to Mr. Odo! This suggests Goldpeak may have been offloading some dangerous or illegal items.
- The sum of money is large: tens of thousands of gold. Compared to Goldpeak's wealth, that's not much, but to anyone else, it's a lot.
- There are several transactions, all of which took place in the last six months. Some were before and some were after the gala.
- Hanamir takes notes on these documents, but leaves the originals. 
- He then checks for secret compartments in the room, but no such luck.

Meanwile, Galadriel tries to get juicy deets from the guards about Goldpeak's arrest.

**Galadriel:** Wow. I can’t even imagine. You’re like SEAL Team Six. How did you get this guy? Were you afraid for your lives??

Initially, one of the guards starts to deny involvement, but then gets nudged by another guard. 

**Guard:** Oh yeah, yeah, we were there!

- He spins a crazy tale of unleashing magical creatures on Goldpeak. His friends aren’t correcting him, but it’s clear this isn’t true.
- These are pretty lower level guards. Paul Blarts.

The infiltrators go to the next room. There are some valuable items in here (including an egg similar to the one snaffled by [Tannin](/characters/tannin/)!). This seems to be a place where more pricey things are kept. Something is missing from the wall—there's a dark spot where a painting clearly used to hang. There’s a large chest that is open in the middle of the floor, and it looks someone has rifled through it. This room is otherwise very neat, so this chest stands out as unusual. Without touching it, Hanamir peers inside and sees:

- fabrics that look to be fancy tapestries
- these fabrics obscure whatever else might be in the chest

He then points the Mirror of the Past at the chest and sees:

- a much younger Goldpeak acquiring the chest at auction
- the chest being used to store various valuable tapestries
- a glimpse of a member of the Amber Guard! He opens it, and it’s unclear what he does next—could be either putting something inside or stealing something.
- Hanamir declines to poke further at the chest, worrying there might be traps inside. 

Back outside, the shift change begins. The two original soldiers head out, and two more soldiers arrive, one of whom wears Amber Guard robes. The Amber Guardsman is a tall man with white hair. Galadriel casts Countercharm to disrupt any mind influencing effects that the Guardsman might attempt. 

**Galadriel:** Welcome, welcome, two more brave first responders including a member of the valorous Amber Guard!!!

- She says this loudly so that the sneaky crew can hopefully hear.
- She then does an encore performance of "Proud to be an Aberithian."

There are two small bedrooms, a reading room, and another art gallery up on the third floor. 

- In the reading room, there is an Amber Guard uniform, hastily discarded! 
- Other than that, there's just a collection of books, in bookshelves, and some nice old artifacts on the table. 

[Harlan](/characters/harlan/) casts Detect Magic (in absentia) and several things glow:

- a sword on the wall
- two or three books
- a small green stone

**Hanamir:** Aha! The transmuter stone! 

Hanamir grabs all of the magical items, and the group leaves the room. He can hear Galadriel's unnaturally loud voice outside, continuing with awestruck flattery, but failing to procure any more details from the new soldiers. Realizing this, she thanks them for their service and (still loudly) announces her departure.

Not long after this, Hanamir hears something—there’s a guard downstairs somewhere. He prepares an escape strategy by tying a rope to a windowsill, but the group presses on.

In one of the bedrooms, there is:

- a strange feeling about the place. A perception check reveals a "familiar feeling," like being near someone we’ve been near before. Not clear who it is. Maybe they were recently here? 
- Chunk casts Detect Magic. There’s an aura in the air coming from a glowing orb. The school of magic is divination. Seems like Clairvoyance! 
- Someone is monitoring this room and probably can see us. 

Hanamir makes a rude gesture to the orb and signals it's time to leave. The party shimmies down the rope and away.

# Mirama again

We rendezvous at the Half Full Flagon. The sneaky ones debrief Galadriel on what they saw, and decide to go through the magical items they stole from the library. The books, it turns out, are spellbooks! 

- They're not easily readable except by the wizard who made them.
- They're certainly valuable. 
- Was Easton Goldpeak a wizard? 
- These books seem to belong to different people, judging by handwriting.

Hanamir pulls out the green stone. He wants to know if it’s really the transmuter stone, the one we knew to be stolen. Harlan does Detect Magic again, and it checks out. 

Hanamir also makes a sketch of the Amber Guard face he saw from the Mirror—the one who was rummaging through the chest.

We bring these items to Mirama. 

- She tells us to get rid fo the sword, there's no use for it. We just stole a random sword, it seems.
- The spellbooks are cool but probably not relevant. 
- The notes, however—these are of interest. It's valuable info that a known crime boss was doing business with Goldpeak. 
- Goldpeak doesn’t need to sell things, usually… but without knowing what these items were, it's hard to say how serious this is. Involvement with Odo might simply be due to the ban on selling magical items.

**Mirama:** If you can tell what these items were, or find the items themselves, that’d be something.

**Galadriel:** How does this compare with what was found in the Kiln?

**Mirama:** There was nothing about Odo in those. Purely a human network. They were semi-coded, and this is more direct. There's no attempt to conceal the transaction here.

Hanamir shows her the sketch of the Amber Guardsman.

**Mirama:** Oh yes, I recognize him. This person is in the Amber Guard, and I sometimes see him in attendance at chamber meetings. His name is… Kelas MacGumbo. 

**Hanamir:** What’s he like?

**Mirama:** He's a young guy… seems normal, though I haven’t interacted with him much. But very recognizable—there's no mistaking the unibrow. 

- We theorize he’s [Kandir](/characters/kandir/)’s lackey or something.

Hanamir tells her about the overall scene, but Mirama is disappointed. Knowing what was taken from the wall or from the chest would have been helpful. The transaction with Odo is the most interesting part—though the fact that someone was watching an area, an unremarkable area, is also interesting. Goldpeak might have had an invenetory of his things, but since we didn’t get one, we're not much better off than we were before.

**Galadriel:** What if we could get a meeting with Mr. Odo? I have connections in the Kiln that might help.

**Mirama:** Oh, dear. Maybe just let the authorities take care of this. I don’t want you getting tied up with a creature like that.

**Galadriel:** What kind of creature?

**Mirama:** Just… don't. Let the Amber Guard proceed with their investigation.

**Galadriel:** But this sketch of Kelas MacGumbo shows we can’t trust the Amber Guard at all. How many shady Guardsmen have there been at this point? I don’t think we can trust them to investigate with any kind of impartiality.

**Mirama:** I understand your concerns, but I'm not ready to write them off as a group.

She scrawls something on a piece of paper and hands it to Tannin.

**Mirama:** McBitters, I’m going to leave it up to you to decide what to do with this information.

With that, our audience with the Minister is done. We thank her and leave. 

On the paper is an address deep in the Kiln. The implication is that this is where Odo’s HQ is. 

**Tannin:** *(in absentia)* AWWWW YEAHHHHH!!

# Black Unicorn again

We make our way to the Kiln. The plan is not to go directly to the address on the paper, but to go back to the Black Unicorn first and ask Slurpt for his take.

**Hanamir:** What do we know about transmuter stones? Can we sell it to Odo for a favor? How rare are they?

**Harlan:** They're not *that* rare, but they're valuable enough that he might be interested.

**Galadriel:** The buying and selling of any magical goods right now is illegal, so he’d be the one to go to.

**Hanamir:** What about the sword? Would Odo be interested in that, do we think?

- The sword is a longsword with jewels in the hilt and an enchantment on it. 
- We investigate it further, and it’s a +1 sword that deals cold damage. 

Upon arriving at the Black Unicorn, we find Slurpt and update him on our situation. We ask for advice on how to deal with Odo.

**Slurpt:** I wouldn't. I don't want to see you die.

**Galadriel:** But you've dealt with him before, right?

**Slurpt:** I don't mean to condescend, but you have no idea what you're dealing with. If you’re gonna do this… be careful. If you have anything of value on you, it’s difficult to get Odo to pay for it. Don’t bring anything in you’re not okay with him just... taking from you.

**Galadriel:** Have you ever seen him in person?

**Slurpt:** Yeah. I have.

**Galadriel:** What is he?

**Slurpt:** I don’t know.

**Galadriel:** What does he look like?

**Slurpt:** … lots of eyes.

**Galadriel:** Oh dip, is he a Beholder??? Big floating ball of eyes???

**Slurpt:** ... Yeah.

**Hanamir** So we need a way to make a deal with him without getting swindled.

**Galadriel:** What do we know about Beholders?

**Chunk:** I only know legends. Many eyes, many tentacles, magic powers. The different eyes are said to have different effects on people. Beholders are very intelligent and often quite paranoid. They’re not wild beasts… they make elaborate schemes, and often find themselves in positions of power. 

**Slurpt:** That sounds about right. He’s a businessman, first and foremost. If you’re of value to him, he might keep things pleasant with you. If not... 

**Galadriel:** Maybe we can take advantage of the fact that he’s feeling insecure about not being the baddest guy in Aberith anymore. Maybe he'd want to exonerate Goldpeak to save his rep. 

**Hanamir:** Maybe we have Tannin hide our valuables somewhere, underwater maybe, we don’t know where, and we tell Odo we'd like to make a deal for them. And as long as none of the rest of us know where Tannin went, Odo won’t be able to get the answer out of us. Or… Harlan could cast Zone of Truth on himself, to prove that he’s telling the truth, and offset Odo’s paranoia of being tricked.

- Due to Chunk missing the next session, we retcon the former plan to be that Chunk takes the quiznos, the Bag of Holding, and everything Odo might want. We tell him to go somewhere and not say where.

**Galadriel:** Slurpt, is there a token of yours that I can bring to prove I’m an associate of the Black Unicorn? That might help gain his trust. 

**Slurpt:** I’ll write you a letter of recommendation. But only because I don't want to see you die.

**Galadriel:** Thank you.

# Odo's place

We venture into the darkest corners of the Kiln. We see some unusual folks—kenku (bird people), more goblins, more half-orcs—people you don’t see in other neighborhoods. There are some other creatures we don’t recognize, including a fish person holding a scrap of trash (a follower of Blibdoolpoolp???). 

Eventually, we get to the address. It's a large, simple building—wide, not tall—like a warehouse. It's made of stone and has a plain wooden door and no windows. It stands out from the decrepit homes surrounding it.

We knock on the door. Two goblins answer it. 

**Galadriel:** Good evening. I am here to propose a business offer for the man in charge. I have a note from a mutual friend, Slurpt Gearix, who can vouch for my honesty.

The goblins step into the light, and we see that they are sewn together. They whisper to each other in Goblin, and gesture us inside. 

We see a large room with a gathering of miscreants inside. Everyone's attention turns to us.

**Goblins:** Humans and elves and dwarves and half-orcs… have come to do business with Mr. Odo.

Everyone laughs.

There’s one loud laugh above the others, and it's coming from a hallway lined with mirrors on both sides. All we see in the mirrors is a mass of tentacles and eyeballs.

**Odo:** Come in.
