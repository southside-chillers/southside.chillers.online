The adventurers hesitate. The speaking skeleton walks closer.

“There’s no need to depart so hastily,” it continues. “Why not stay a little longer?”

[Tannin](/characters/tannin/) and [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) glance at each other and ready their weapons. But as they prepare to charge, a bolt of lightning connects with the ground beneath the group of skeletons, illuminating their bones for a fraction of a second, then exploding them. When the dust clears, only four skeletons remain standing.

“Kord be praised!” comes [Harlan](/characters/harlan/)’s voice from above, on the back of the giant bat. His lone hand, still crackling with electricity, is raised in blessing. ([Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) makes a mental note that this tableau should be the cover art for the metal album she will one day compose about this very adventure.)

“I was merely inviting you to stay,” says the skeleton coolly. He and his compatriots step aside to let the adventurers pass.

They approach the forbidding black wall at the edge of the city. The four skeletons watch on without showing aggression, but also without retreating.

“You guys can leave us alone now,” Tannin suggests. Their empty eye sockets stare back at him.

“Let’s just go,” says [Hermione](/characters/hermione/). “Now, quickly, before they try to pull any more tricks.”

“So we’re all right with them seeing how we leave?” says Hanamir. “And that we’re leaving with…” He points behind himself to his backpack, where [Redyl](/characters/redyl/) is stowed away.

“I think we’ve given the Lich enough contextual clues at this point for him to be aware that the rings are special,” says Galadriel. “And if he sees everything in the city, he’ll already have seen us talking to Redyl at the inn.”

Hanamir nods and sets his backpack down to let Redyl out. 

“Who’s this?” the Savage grunts. 

“We’ll explain later,” says Hermione, dancing back and forth on her feet. “Please, let’s go. Who’s in the first group?”

“I’ll give my ring to Redyl and stay behind while he crosses,” says Hanamir. He slips off his Ring of Been and hands it to the gnome.

“And I will stay and tackle you again, if you need me to,” says Tannin with an air of noble sacrifice.

“I’ll pass through and then come back to give you Redyl’s ring,” says Galadriel.

“I can’t really hear you guys, but I’m just gonna fly through the wall now,” Harlan calls down from the air.

And with that, Harlan, Hermione, Redyl, Galadriel, and the Savage pass through the wall. It takes a few seconds—they’re not running, this time—and the sensation of being inside the illusion of a solid structure is extraordinary. Galadriel feels as though her internal organs have expanded to fill the volume of the wall. She breathes deeply when she reaches the other side, not really looking forward to crossing through it twice more. 

Redyl hands her the extra ring.

“Go bring back Mr. Hanamir,” he urges her. “I won’t feel like I’ve truly escaped until he’s out, too.”

Galadriel passes back into the City of the Dead, expecting to see something horrible: Hanamir and Tannin being eviscerated by an army of undead, or the Lich holding them hostage, or no sign of them at all. But the pair of them are standing right where she left them not half a minute ago. 

“All good?” she asks. She tosses the ring back to Hanamir. He puts it on.

“I guess,” says Tannin. He looks askance at the four skeletons, who still watch them from a distance. 

“All right, then, team,” says Hanamir. “Let’s go.”

The three of them walk through the wall and emerge on the other side. They’re greeted by cheers from Harlan, Hermione, and Redyl. The Savage, aloof as ever, is busy taking a swig from his water flask.

“I can’t believe how well that went!” says Hermione. 

“Me neither, frankly,” says Harlan, who has landed his bat. “What’s the catch?”

“If there is one, I’m sure we’ll find out soon enough,” says Hanamir. He looks soberly toward the Savage.

“Are you not certain that the Lich has been banished from my mind?” says the Savage. 

“I believe you are no longer under his influence, but I do not think we yet know the consequences of all that transpired in the city,” says Hanamir.

The Savage gives him a curt nod.

“Until then,” says Hermione. “Where should we go next?”

“Eillin? To check in with Frunk?” Tannin floats.

“Remember, we have a meeting with Magic in Aberith in four days,” says Harlan.

“Eillin is on the way,” says Galadriel, “and Frunk needs to know what we’ve learned.”

“I, too, would like to speak to Frunk,” says the Savage. 

“Eillin it is, then,” says Harlan. 

The adventurers set off. The simple act of putting distance between themselves and the City of the Dead has a noticeable effect on their moods. Even Hanamir’s attitude seems markedly more jovial once the wall is out of sight; he carries Redyl on his shoulders like a toddler. Hermione has ceased her nervous fidgeting. Tannin levitates the dew from the grass ahead of them and makes it shimmy in the air to the rhythm of Galadriel’s lute strumming. Harlan, soaring ahead of them on his bat, looks downright joyful.

“So, what I still don’t understand,” Hanamir says to the Savage, “is how you got into the city.”

“I’ll be honest with you,” says the Savage. “I had no idea the Rings of Been allowed you to pass through the wall. I did not know what a danger it was that I had two of them on my person.”

“Frunk never told you?” says Galadriel.

“No,” says the Savage. “It must have been information reserved for higher-order members. And... you all, I guess.” He stares ahead sourly.

“That seems wildly irresponsible,” says Hermione. “I mean, given that the possession of one of those rings would allow the Lich to escape, I can’t understand why Frunk did not make every owner of every ring aware of its power.”

The Savage bristles at her.

“I trust he had his reasons,” he says.

“So how did you get in, then?” Hanamir repeats.

“That’s all a bit fuzzy to me,” says the Savage. “I don’t remember. On my way to the city, something happened to me, and I… found myself inside.”

“That’s really bad,” says Galadriel. “It means that taking the rings outside the city doesn’t make you safe. Someone with a ring can be compelled to go back in.”

“When we talk to Frunk, we should tell him the rings need to be locked away somewhere for good,” says Hermione.

“Or turned into toe rings, so that nobody will ever wear them,” says Tannin. “Not even the Lich.”

“Or destroyed entirely,” says Galadriel.

“I would like to be part of this conversation!” Harlan yells down at them.

“We’ll be at Eillin soon, and then we’ll all get a chance to talk,” says Hanamir.

“What?!” shouts Harlan.

---

At the edge of Eillin, they reach a heavily-guarded checkpoint. 

“No one enters and no one leaves the town,” says a guard. “Please be on your way elsewhere.”

“I’m certain Mayor Frunk will make an exception for us,” says Galadriel. “Don’t you recognize us?” She assesses the guards, trying to determine how big of a charm bomb she will have to detonate on them in order to get her way.

“The mayor does not have the authority to make an exception,” says the guard, stony-faced.

“Then who does?” says Tannin. He’s not really listening for an answer. He turns around and waggles his eyebrows at the party, just itching to let loose on these goons. 

“None but the king of Aberith,” says the guard.

“Well, could the mayor come up to the border and speak to us here?” says Hanamir.

The guard looks annoyed. 

“No one enters *or* leaves,” he repeats.

“Right, but if he just comes right up to the edge, he won’t be leaving and we won’t be—” starts Hermione, but she’s interrupted by Harlan. His voice booms over the airspace above Eillin, reverberating off walls and buildings.

“HEY FRUNK,” he alerts the entire town, “WE’RE BACK.” He then adds, “IT’S HARLAN.”

The guard throws up his hands and resumes his post, cursing. In a few minutes, the adventurers see a familiar dwarf hurrying down the path toward the checkpoint. He argues with the guards for a moment—they want to supervise the meeting—but Frunk uses his ace in the hole. 

“The king will hear about this,” he says. 

At that, the guards back down. Frunk beckons the party to come forward and greets them with a weary enthusiasm.

“Glad to see you all made it out of there in one piece,” he says. “Plus a few more, I see.” He nods at Tannin, and gives Redyl a respectful but confused handshake. His eyes widen at the sight of Harlan landing his bat. When his gaze reaches the Savage, he throws his arms wide and embraces him.

“We missed you! We thought we’d be seeing you at the Moon Festival!” he says.

“I had to investigate the orc threat,” says the Savage, who is clearly uncomfortable being hugged. “I found myself imprisoned by the Lich. Then these people here stumbled in without much strategy, or grace…” 

He sneers this last part. Galadriel makes a huffy, insulted noise. 

“Anyway, I’m in a weakened state, and I need somewhere to rest. Can I stay with you?” says the Savage.

“I’m afraid they’re very serious about no one entering or leaving the town,” says Frunk. 

“In that case, I suppose I’ll head to Aberith,” says the Savage.

“You know, you could be a bit more appreciative!” Galadriel snaps. He ignores her.

“We have a lead on who might be responsible for Bryn’s murder,” Harlan says to the Savage. “Would you be interested in helping us track her down in Aberith?”

“To neutralize the threat to Eillin, yes, I would,” says the Savage, making it clear that he would not be interested in doing it just to continue hanging out with them. “It is my duty.”

“Good,” says Harlan. He turns back to Frunk. “Has anything else suspicious or noteworthy happened since we last saw you?”

“No, no,” sighs Frunk. “Everyone’s on edge because of the lockdown, but nothing much has gone on other than some outrage at the cancellation of an upcoming concert, since the band can’t enter town limits.” He rolls his eyes. “My house has been egged repeatedly. I didn’t even make this rule.”

“Yikes,” says Galadriel. “What band, though?”

“The Backstreet Bards,” says Frunk. 

“What?!” cries Galadriel. “You deserve worse than eggs!”

“Sorry, sorry,” says Harlan, pulling Galadriel aside. “We wanted to let you know that the Savage here was the Lich’s prisoner because he’d been compelled to enter the city—we don’t know how this was possible outside of the wall—and was possessed by the Lich when we encountered him inside.”

“It is lucky that I did not know of the rings’ power while the Lich was in my head,” says the Savage, with a hint of resentment in his voice. “But I entered the city, not knowing that the two rings I possessed were two opportunities for the Lich to unleash total destruction upon the continent. This was a great danger.” He stares at Frunk, awaiting an explanation.

“Bryn created the rings,” says Frunk. “I did not have any part in that.”

“Yes, but you *knew*, and didn’t tell him,” says Hermione sharply. “Is there any reason why we should not destroy them?”

“Bryn is the only one who truly understood them,” says Frunk, eyes downcast. “And he and Uncle were the ones who sealed the city. But it seems like you may have a point.” He pauses. “I had hoped… foolishly, it now seems… that it was just a terrible rumor. That there was not really a Lich in the City of the Dead.”

“Well, there definitely is!” says Tannin blithely.

A long silence follows. Each of them searches for something to say, but finds nothing—minds empty as the hands of firefly chasers. Finally, the quietest one speaks.

“I am dissatisfied,” says Hanamir. “But I think traveling onward to Aberith is the right move.”

“I do hope your theories about this suspect bear fruit,” says Frunk. “It would be a great relief to put this murder behind us and find justice for Bryn.”

They say their goodbyes and watch as Frunk returns up the pathway toward town. When he is out of sight, they take their first steps toward the great city of Aberith.

---

The sun shines high over the gently sloping meadows north of Eillin. 

“And there’s where we fought Guz and his polymorphed goons.” Galadriel points to a nondescript hillock near a small thicket of trees. “And Harlan talked to a bird to tell it to go get Hanamir.”

Redyl nods and makes all the requisite noises to indicate interest, but seems distracted. 

“You all right up there, Redyl?” asks Hanamir. He has the gnome sitting on his shoulders again in order to spare him the strain of keeping up on foot with the rest of the longer-legged party.

“Oh, yes, I’m just fine; thank you for asking,” says Redyl. “I admit I’m preoccupied with worries about my children. And without my magical supplies, I do feel… vulnerable.”

Harlan has opted to walk, at least for this portion of the journey, while his bat stays close in the sky. He gives Hanamir a nudge.

“Hey, you think Shinebright had anything Redyl might find useful, until he can get new supplies?” he says.

“We could stop by our rental property, just in case, and take a look,” says Hanamir. “Check in with H’Jun, too.”

“Hold up, what?” says Tannin. “You guys have a rental property now?”

“So, uh, yeah,” says Galadriel, chewing on her lip. “Remember that monster you mentioned? Fleshy horror, lots of mouths? That used to be the owner of this tower up ahead.” She squints and points at the emerging shape of Shinebright’s tower in the distance. 

“Did you do that to him?” says Tannin, with a mixture of disgust and respect.

“Yeah, and you’re the one who technically killed him, so you’re in on this grift, too.” She grins at him slyly, then shrugs. “Anyway, he literally begged us to do it, so.”

“It’s a comfort to know I’m not the only victim of this group’s haphazard attempts at adventuring,” mutters the Savage, who has been quiet since their departure from Eillin.

“I’m gonna go ahead and pretend I did not hear any of this,” says Hermione.

They approach the tower in good spirits, with Galadriel and Harlan reminiscing about the talking sheep, the nail-biter of a battle with Noke and the bed dragon, and the final, unenviable fate of both Noke and Shinebright. When they arrive at the gate surrounding the property, they can see H’Jun hunched over in the herb garden that Harlan planted.

“Would you look at that! He’s taking care of my plants,” says Harlan. “I knew this responsibility would help him turn things around.”

They come closer, and Harlan’s face falls. H’Jun is vomiting all over the spring peas. 

“Oh, hi guys,” mumbles H’Jun, wiping his mouth on his sleeve. “Rain’ll clean that off. What… why you… I mean, what brings you all here?”

“You okay?” says Galadriel.

“Totally, totally,” says H’Jun. “And you know what, I’m almost out of all the ale I brought with me, so that’s good, right? Then I won’t have any more.”

“Sure,” says Harlan. “So what have you been up to?”

“Uhhhhh,” says H’Jun. “Well, I have my tools, and I was thinking of doing some repairs on the outhouse, you know, for the… for the tenants…”

“Found one of those yet, big guy?” asks Hanamir. 

“Not yet… a few leads, though… don’t worry,” says H’Jun. “My word is— *hic* —my bond.”

“Well, mind if we go inside for a bit?” says Harlan. “Our friend here is a wizard who’s been robbed of his implements, and we’d like to see if Shinebright left anything he could use.”

“By all means, please.” H’Jun gives them a wave toward the door with an elaborate bow and tips over into the chives.

The magical supplies remaining in the tower, such as they are, are of very little interest to Redyl. 

“This was a transmutation wizard, you say?” he says, inspecting a cloudy set of crystals.

“Yes,” says Harlan. “But not a very good one.”

“I could take some of the more quotidian supplies,” says Redyl. “Can always use a bag of ash or some shards of bone. But I’m afraid there’s not much else for me here.”

“Sorry, Redyl,” says Hermione. “We’ll be in Aberith soon enough, and you can get higher-quality things there.”

“We’ll spot you the gold,” says Hanamir.

Redyl bows.

“My gratitude to you all is unending,” he says.

After a short rest in the tower, they decide it would be best to get a move on. They will need to travel at a quick pace in order to reach Aberith in time to meet up with Magic. The Savage trails several yards behind them all, brooding. Back atop Hanamir’s shoulders, Redyl is reassuring them that he didn’t have high hopes for another wizard’s supplies, anyway.

“I’d need my arcane focus,” he explains. “It was an amulet. It allowed me to channel my magical energy, and that’s how most of my magic was done.” He nods at Hermione. “You’re a wizard, you understand.”

“Of course,” she says. “I know it’s a long shot, but would you happen to have any use for this?” Hermione reaches up and hands him the amulet she found in the fire at the abandoned orc camp.

“How did you…?” says Redyl. His eyes widen. “This is the amulet of an ancient king!”

“We thought it might be something important. But we didn’t recognize the name inscribed there,” says Hermione.

“This is—ancient isn’t even the right word. Legendary is more apt,” explains Redyl. “Geril IV was a king of Teron.”

“Teron, like… the City of the Dead?” says Harlan. “The skeletons there were all calling it that.”

“I don’t know if that’s true,” says Redyl. “It could be. No one knows for sure where Teron was. It was the capital city of an empire that fell long ago.” 

“How do you know all this?” says Tannin, brow furrowed skeptically, staring up at the gnome.

“About Teron? I learned it in school,” says Redyl. “Everyone I know did. But I’m from a gnome community, of course, in the forest at the northern edge of the continent.”

“What else do you know about Teron?” asks Hermione, as Redyl hands the amulet back to her.

“Well, let’s see,” he says. “It was ruled by an unbroken line of seven and a half kings. That part is easy to remember.” Redyl chuckles at their confused faces. “They possessed a great power that was passed down from king to king, and it allowed them to prolong their lives. Most of them lived a century, or a century and a half at most, and then handed it down to their child. But Geril VI, the sixth king… he decided to live for a thousand years. And when he eventually died, he gave the power to his son, and that’s when things started to go badly.”

“What happened?” Hermione looks fascinated but also a bit miffed that this story was left out of her history courses.

“Geril VII had a difficult time as a ruler. Within thirty years of his succession, the city was completely bankrupt. And Teron, remember, had been the most powerful city in the empire. It fell into ruin—burned down, in the end, I believe,” says Redyl, scratching his head. “This was all thousands of years ago, mind you. These stories could be as much myth as history. But primary sources do suggest it was a real place.”

Hermione turns the amulet over in her hands, thinking.

“We should show this to King Slee, and see what he makes of it,” she says. 

“I think it’s bad news,” murmurs Hanamir. “If Teron is indeed the City of the Dead…”

“Why wait?” says Tannin. “We could just smash it now.”

Redyl laughs and looks down at Tannin. 

“You remind me of my son,” he says. “Headstrong. Rash. Thinks he’s invincible.” The anxious creases return to his face. “I worry about him, especially what he’d do to try and rescue me. Rompit’s never been one to shy away from danger. But he’s smart, and he’s well-trained, so he gets away with a lot.” Redyl sighs. “Syndra’s got a good head on her shoulders, and I hope she’d keep him in line. I have faith in both of them, of course, but... the magical dispatches I sent out… there’s been no response.”

“They sound like great kids, Redyl,” says Hanamir. “And one of us saw your son quite recently. There’s reason to hope.” 

“Yes, he seemed in pretty good shape when I met him,” says Hermione. “The prison was awful and dark, but we were both glad not to be alone. He didn’t tell me anything of his plans, though. I think he was keeping his secrets close to the chest.”

“Did you see any other prisoners?” asks Redyl.

“No, just Rompit. Did you?” 

“Yes, yes. Prisoners, co-conspirators, all kinds of strange folk. I was being kept above ground, though,” says Redyl.

“What were the people like?” asks Harlan.

“The first thing that struck me was how strange it was that they were meeting with drow,” says Redyl. “Orcs and drow—you don’t see them together much. But the drow were part of their scheme to kill Gruumsh, I think.”

“That sounds right,” says Hanamir. “We defeated a faction of drow who were attempting to kill another god, Eilistraee, and they were in league with orcs.”

“Yes, I don’t think Gruumsh was the only target. It seemed much bigger than that. I saw creatures coming and going that I couldn’t even identify—tentacles on their faces and whatnot.” 

“And the other prisoners?” says Hermione.

“There were many. Spellcasters, all of them. The orcs burned through them quickly. I’d see them form expeditions and attempt the plane-shifting spell, trying to get to where they were trying to go, and they were all failures. A lot of people died. I was there three months, watching all of this. When it was my turn, I got lucky.” 

He pauses to take a breath, smiling wryly. 

“Not sure if it was truly lucky, or unlucky, actually. But my spell worked, and we went through the Shadowfell to the City of the Dead. [Khargol](/characters/khargol/) then came through the portal after us. I don’t know what became of the other orcs who didn’t come with us, or of the remaining tuning forks they had with them.”

The party walks in silence for awhile, turning this information over. The afternoon bleeds into evening, and the setting sun makes them all a little sluggish. Harlan whistles for his bat to carry him awhile. Under the pink sky, the terrain is flatter now, with no forests or rivers in sight, though a faint marshy smell is in the air.

Galadriel walks side-by-side with Buddy. She has noticed that since his admission that he’s not really a pig, he’s been more open about his preference to trot alongside her rather than peek out from the top of her backpack. Sometimes he still gets tired, what with his little legs, and he’ll go back in—but it makes Galadriel happy to see him in this new light. 

*He’s growing up so fast,* she can’t help but think. *Sorry. I know you’re not a baby, if you’re listening.*

HAHA. THAT’S OKAY. 

Galadriel shivers, but not because she’s frightened. It’s just that having one’s train of thought interrupted by someone else’s is not an experience that she thinks she’ll ever get used to.

GALADRIEL, HOW MUCH DO YOU TRUST THE PEOPLE WE’RE TRAVELING WITH?

*With my life!*

EVEN THE NEW ONES?

*Oh, well, we really just met the gnome, but he seems sincere. I don’t have solid proof, but I think he’s trustworthy.*

YOU KNOW I’VE COME TO TRUST YOU. AND… ONLY YOU.

Galadriel is unable to suppress her joy. She smiles at Buddy, eyes twinkling.

*Aw, Buddy. That means a lot. I trust you too.*

I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I THINK SOMEONE WITH US HAS AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE. 

*Wait. You don’t mean Hermione, Tannin, Hanamir, or Harlan, right?*

NO.

*So… you’re worried about the Savage, then?*

MAYBE. SOMETHING FEELS DIFFERENT NOW THAT THE NEWCOMERS ARE HERE.

*We’ve fought next to him before, and he’s always been on our side, even if he’s not a great guy personally. Is it that you think the influence of the Lich isn’t fully gone?*

I DON’T KNOW. I WISH I DID. BUT UNTIL I FIGURE OUT WHAT’S GOING ON, I JUST WANTED TO EXPLAIN TO YOU THAT THIS IS WHY I INTEND TO REMAIN A PIG FOR THE TIME BEING. 

*Oh, I understand. You don’t need to explain yourself to me. Whenever you’re ready to stop being a pig, that’s up to you.*

HAHA. I’VE BEEN READY FOR AWHILE.

Galadriel’s heart does a somersault. 

*Oh?*

YES. THIS PRANK HAS GONE ON FAR TOO LONG.

*...Prank?*

SORRY. I’LL BACK UP. I TURNED MYSELF INTO A PIG AS A PRANK.

Galadriel’s mind is actually blank. All of her theories on why Buddy did this, or why this was done to him, have fallen through a trap door at the base of her skull, promptly devoured by sharks in the pit below. It never, ever occurred to her that Buddy might be a pig because… *comedy.*

I CAN FEEL THAT YOU’RE CONFUSED. I KNOW. THE PRANK GOT OUT OF HAND. I KEPT THINKING ‘MAYBE NOW WOULD BE THE FUNNIEST TIME TO REVEAL MY TRUE FORM.’ BUT THEN EVEN FUNNIER OPPORTUNITIES WOULD BE JUST DOWN THE LINE, AND I’D HOLD OFF. AND I JUST KEPT HOLDING OFF.

*Totally.*

REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE ON TOP OF THAT TOWER? I WAS SO CLOSE TO DOING IT THEN. BUT THEN WHAT YOU DID WAS REALLY FUNNY TOO, SO…

*It would have stolen your prank thunder. I get it.*

YES. SO I’VE BEEN WAITING AWHILE.

Galadriel gathers up some of her composure.

*I bet when you finally do it, it’ll be worth it. Best prank of all time?*

I HOPE SO. BUT NOW I DON’T THINK I SHOULD DO IT AROUND THE NEWCOMERS AT ALL. AND—I KNOW HE’S NOT A NEWCOMER, BUT—DID YOU NOTICE THAT YOUR DWARF FRIEND CAME BACK AND HE’S A FISH MAN NOW?

*Yes! Isn’t that the coolest?*

I’M IN YOUR BACKPACK, JUST EATING YOUR PROVISIONS AND STUFF, AND I POP MY HEAD OUT AND HE’S A FISH MAN NOW? 

*Are you jealous? It’s a pretty good twist. Almost a prank, if it’d been intentional.*

HA.

*But really, Tannin’s a great guy, don’t worry about him. I’m sure he’d admire your commitment to landing a joke.*

I GUESS WE’LL FIND OUT AT SOME POINT, RIGHT? 

*I guess so.*

WELL, YOU SEEM LIKE YOU’RE DOING ALL RIGHT. BUT IF YOU EVER NEED MY HELP, LET ME KNOW.

*If you happen to know anything more about the Lich, that would be a huge help.*

AH, NOPE. I’M TOO YOUNG TO KNOW MUCH. I’M JUST ABOUT SIX HUNDRED.

*Six hundred?!*

YEAH. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS? A THOUSAND?

*No! I’m only fifty, and the rest of the group… well, I’m not sure, but no one’s as old as you.*

BUT YOU’RE SO BIG! HOW ARE YOU ONLY FIFTY?

*I’m a pretty average-sized adult, for what I am. Do you know what I am? I’m half-elf, half-human. How big do you think I should be?*

NOT TOO FAMILIAR WITH ELVES AS A SPECIES, I’LL ADMIT. BUT FIFTY? YOU’RE AN INFANT. YOU SHOULD LOOK LIKE A BABY ELF.

*Sorry, that is incorrect.*

Galadriel is giggling aloud, and the others in the group turn and give her some quizzical looks. She waves them off. 

“Just thinking about funny stuff from the other day,” she says. “You know. Nothing. Whatever.”

NICE COVER STORY, YOU BABY!

*Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, now that we’re getting into personal details, do you mind telling me why you were in that spider cave inside the well, where I found you?*

THEY DUG THAT STUPID THING INTO MY HOME LIKE TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

*Who did? Why were the spiders there?*

I DON’T KNOW.

*And what was with that gauntlet that I made you throw up? Why did you swallow that?*

OH, THAT? THAT WAS ON SOME DROW I ATE.

If Galadriel’s heart did a somersault before, it now does a quad salchow with a messy landing.

*Oh, um… oh!*

IT WAS A LITTLE BUMPY IN THERE WHEN I SHRANK DOWN INTO MY PIG SIZE. IT FIT A LOT BETTER IN MY REGULAR STOMACH.

Her pulse is pounding. Buddy is large enough to eat a drow? Buddy ate a drow? How big is Buddy’s regular stomach?

*Well… it’s attached to my arm forever, now.* 

YEAH, HOW’S THAT GOING?

*It’s been weird, but there are perks. I mean, you’ve seen, obviously. I can climb on walls and ceilings and stuff.*

SOMETIMES I LOOK OUT OF THE BACKPACK AND I’M LIKE ‘WHOA, WE’RE UPSIDE DOWN, THAT’S COOL, BETTER HANG ON.’ THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I WORRIED YOU FORGOT ABOUT ME IN THERE.

*No, no, no! I’d never forget about you. It’s just that in combat, I want to make sure you’re safe, and it’s safest when no one even knows to target you. And as long as you’re strapped in there, you won’t fall, I promise.*

GALADRIEL, YOU REALLY DON’T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT ME. BUT I APPRECIATE IT. YOU JUST LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU NEED ME, OR WHEN YOU THINK OF A REALLY FUNNY TIME FOR ME TO REVEAL MY TRUE FORM.

*Okay, Buddy. Good to know. I’ll try not to worry about you.*

Without warning, Galadriel feels her eyes start to well with tears. 

*Love you.*

In place of a goodbye, Buddy sends a different kind of thought into Galadriel’s mind. It is infinitesimally brief. It’s a vision, and it makes her stop in her tracks as the rest of the party continues walking.

She sees a dragon, enormous, decked in glittering scales, unfurling its massive wings and shaking its horned head. It glows with a warm light. She is unable to draw breath. A feeling she might have called fear is washing over her, but it calls itself awe.

When the vision disappears—and it does, so quickly that she then wonders if she imagined it—she continues walking, giving her legs explicit instructions to move forward. Left, then right, then left. By her side, the little pig oinks contentedly, scuffling through the night-cooled grass.

“We should set up camp,” says Hanamir. “We have another long day of walking tomorrow.”

Hermione groans. Harlan brings the bat down, treating them all to a soothing breeze from its wings as it lands. The Savage finally catches up to them, but then starts setting up his bedroll a noticeable distance away.

“What’s with you, Moonwater?” says Tannin. He spreads out his own bedroll on a horrible patch of bumpy ground, then dives into it. “You’re never this quiet. You’re usually loud and annoying. Bards, am I right?!” He reaches out to give Harlan a high five, and is ignored.

*I am, at this moment in time, spooning with a DRAGON. There is a DRAGON in my sleeping bag. A six hundred year old DRAGON is my pet pig.*

She listens to the sound of crickets and the chorus of the other adventurers breathing. 

*This unfathomably deadly creature is my favorite person in the world.*

The gods of sleep must have been waiting for her to acknowledge this. To her surprise, they let her sink into dreams without much ado.
