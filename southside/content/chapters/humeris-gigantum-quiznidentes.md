[Harlan](/characters/harlan/) finishes wrapping [Tannin](/characters/tannin/)’s wrist stump with bandages.

“There,” he says. “It’s really not so bad, I promise. And we already know where to go to get it fixed this time around!”

Tannin stares at the ground and makes a pitiful noise.

“And hey, what about that wand?” Harlan continues. “The Wand of Lightning Bolts? We could just attach it to your arm instead of to your trident. That’d be cool, right?”

“I guess so,” sniffs Tannin.

“Can we agree to get rid of the satchel of bread? ” says [Hermione](/characters/hermione/), searching the group for consensus. “It’s claimed two hands now, and—”

“No!” says Tannin. He clutches the satchel to his chest with his one remaining hand. “No way! This bread is an awesome deal!” His voice rises in both volume and pitch. “It only sometimes eats a hand! The rest of the time it’s amazing!”

“Well, I suppose it’s up to you,” says [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/). After a silence that reveals the extent of the adventurers’ lack of interest in arguing with Tannin, he changes the subject. “Shall we check out those dead bodies over there, or what?”

The skeletons definitely belong to a set of explorers. One of their bony hands still holds a detailed map of the temple, marked to indicate that they had rappelled up the side of the pyramid into this very room, where they were apparently crushed by falling debris. 

“Looks like they had a few places they knew they wanted to check out,” says Hermione. “And a few places they were told to avoid. That room with the cat guy has a skull and crossbones drawn over it.”

“And it looks like we’re on the first of three above-ground tiers,” says Hanamir. He cranes his neck and scans the room. “That door over there looks like it corresponds with this one on the map, with stairs leading up to the second tier.”

“Stairs?!” [Magick](/characters/magick/) whispers, eyes wide. “Yes, stairs! Let’s go—go to the stairs now—up and up, higher and higher—”

“Maybe let’s just see what’s behind this other door we haven’t checked before we move on,” says [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/). “They didn’t mark it in any way. Hanamir, can you take a peek?”

Hanamir approaches a heavy stone door in one corner of the jungle room. Its face is overgrown with vines, and they might not have noticed it without the map. He holds an ear to the crack for a moment, then pushes it open as quietly as he can.

Inside, he sees a dark, windowless room. A woman, translucent but contoured in glowing light, stands in a cloud of dust. She turns to him, revealing a haunting, tear-streaked face.

Hanamir shuts the door.

“Nothing in there,” he says, jogging back over to the group.

“Excellent,” says Harlan. “If no one objects, let’s try going back to the cat room and looking at the door we missed in there. These explorers have it marked on their map, but it’s unclear if they meant to seek it out or avoid it.”

“I object!” says Magick. “We need to go up the stairs! And I feel like my condition is much better now, and I could be very valuable—very helpful to you all if you’d only unshackle me—”

“Sorry, but still no,” says Hermione. “Let’s go.”

The adventurers retrace their steps through the room with the dead tentacle tree, then back to the cat room. The remaining unexplored door is decorated with yet more images of cats.

Hanamir leads the way. The air in the chamber beyond is warm and somewhat damp; it smells fetid, almost like a bog. It glows with a bluish haze.

“We still wanna do this?” whispers Galadriel.

“Could be great treasure in here,” says Hanamir.

Harlan points to the far wall and frowns. Some kind of oddly-shaped, leathery material is mounted there.

“I am going to bet that those tapestries are made of people,” he says. “And I hope that I am wrong.”

“There’s also a really intense-looking whip hanging up there,” says Galadriel, pointing. “Everyone see the whip? Everyone still cool with this?”

“Just let me look around a bit,” says Hanamir. 

The most prominent features of the room, other than the maybe-human skins and the cat o’ nine tails, are a blackened mirror on one wall and an enormous statue of a giant, its gaping mouth wide enough to swallow a horse. The statue stands on a basin over smoldering coals, which is the likely source of the marshy air. A flicker of movement in the dark blue haze reveals a panther prowling around the base of the statue. It does not react to the adventurers’ entrance. Beyond the statue, there is a well emanating a watery light. And above the well is a small opening in the ceiling, about five feet wide. 

“Seen enough?” Hermione whispers. “That panther makes me nervous. What’s it doing? Can it not see us?”

Upon noticing the hole in the ceiling, Galadriel is newly interested in the room. She scampers up the side of one wall and creeps along the gently-sloped ceiling.

“I can’t climb up into this,” she says. “Something is preventing me. Like the walls of the pit—the magenta ones—before the cave-in…”

Harlan approaches the well and peers over its walled sides.

“Anything you notice about the well from above?” he asks. “There’s a liquid in here. Not sure what it is.”

“Nothing remarkable,” says Galadriel. “But let’s see what happens if I Mage Hand some of it.”

She summons her magical third hand and directs it to grab an empty flask from her belt. It floats gently down into the well, reappearing with a flask full of the fluid.

“All right,” says Galadriel. “So it’s a real physical substance that can be scooped and poured. That’s… something.”

Seemingly prompted by the disturbance of the well, a voice in a harsh, guttural language reverberates throughout the room.

“Giant!” hisses Hermione. “The voice is speaking Giant! Ugh, I hope I remember enough of the declensions to answer politely… it’s a highly inflected language… and I mean, I know I look great for my age, but it’s been awhile since thaumazoological grad school…”

“A giant?” says Tannin, perking up considerably. “What’s it saying?”

“It says, ‘I am Zipe; who are you and what have you come for?’” she translates. “Okay, I’m just going to wing it. I think I remember how to ask for directions properly.”

“Hello... very much!” says Hermione in Giant. “So piquant to be hearing from you. Would you... can... explain to us the way in which we are out?”

The voice replies, sounding mournful.

“It says ‘I suggest you leave,’” Hermione whispers. “What should I say back?” 

But Tannin and Hanamir have left her side to explore other parts of the room; Hanamir is circling the base of the statue, while Tannin tries to get the panther’s attention, to no avail. He waves his trident in its face, and it just sits there licking itself.

“I wonder what happens if I pour some of this on the ground?” Galadriel is calling down to Harlan, who stands beneath her with his arms crossed. “Careful, I don’t want to get any on you.”

She pours a quick dollop of the liquid from the flask in the Mage Hand down to the floor, where it pools unremarkably near Harlan’s feet.

“Hmm,” says Harlan. He bends down and dips a finger in the puddle. 

“Dude!” says Galadriel. “We don’t know what that is!”

Harlan watches his hand as the strange shimmering liquid begins spreading over his skin, soon enveloping his index finger.

“Hmm,” Harlan says again, his frown deepening. “I guess I didn’t think that through. It was a Galadriel moment, one might say.”

“Excuse me?” says Galadriel.

“You heard me,” smirks Harlan. He casts Detect Magic. “Well, it’s definitely magical. Same with the hole in the ceiling. And the panther—something about its eyes. Nothing else.”

“Not even this statue?” says Hanamir, squatting near its base.

“Nope, just a statue,” says Harlan. The liquid has swallowed his entire hand, but doesn’t appear to be doing any damage. “I am concerned about this. I regret everything. Oh, [Kord](/characters/kord/). I can’t lose a hand again.”

“I thought losing a hand was no big deal?” sneers Tannin.

“Of course it’s a big deal!” says Harlan, panicking. “I was just trying to make you feel better! Obviously!”

Hermione, realizing she will be receiving no guidance from her friends, addresses the bodiless voice again in what she hopes is gramatically correct Giant.

“Sorry, please. My family is lost. We do not hope that we are doing you in an annoying way. What is this... juicy business?” She bites her lip, knowing that wasn’t right. “The, uhh… the watery business? Moistness? From the round... floor... source?”

Another raspy, solemn series of sounds emanates from the hole in the ceiling.

“It says we should take as much as we want from the well and get out,” says Hermione in Common, sounding confused. “So I guess the stuff isn’t dangerous, Harlan.”

“That could be a trick!” Harlan cries, watching the shiny liquid climb up his arm. “It could be its poisonous urine! The well could be its bathroom! If I die from touching monster pee because I was feeling reckless for one second, I will be so mad, I swear to Kord!”

“Did you do the watery business?” Hermione calls up to the giant. “Is it… a terrible water? Or a pleasing water?”

To this, there is no reply, just a sound like something enormous rolling over in the room above them.

“No response? Great. Just great,” sighs Harlan, as his shoulder is engulfed. “It’s been nice knowing all of you. Take care of Zotz for me.”

Meanwhile, the panther has finally taken notice of one of the adventurers, and it’s not Tannin, in spite of his energetic trident-twirling.

HEY, GALADRIEL? I THINK THE PANTHER SEES ME.

Galadriel looks down from the ceiling and sees the panther staring at [Buddy](/characters/buddy/) from across the room, where he sits with Magick. The panther’s muscles are tensed, its ears flattened.

*Oh no*, she thinks. *Do you think it knows what you are?*

NAH, IT DOESN’T KNOW. BUT I’VE SPENT LONG ENOUGH IN THIS FORM TO RECOGNIZE WHEN SOMEONE IS CRAVING BACON.

*Ha! Well, it can’t see me. I’ll drop down onto its back and—*

NO NEED FOR THAT. I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW WHAT’S UP. YOU HAVE A GIANT TO FIGHT.

*You think? This guy doesn’t seem to want to come down, and I can’t climb up there.*

ASK HANAMIR TO GIVE YOU HIS GRAPPLING HOOK AND TRY USING THAT.

“Hey, Hanamir?” says Galadriel. “Toss me your grappling hook, would you?”

“Sure thing,” says Hanamir. He underhand pitches it up to the ceiling, and she catches it. “You going up?”

“Yeah,” she says. She unravels the rope attached to the hook and lets it fall to the floor, where it coils in a loose circle. “Join me?”

Galadriel launches the grappling hook into the hole in the ceiling. It scrapes against something before shifting and locking into place. She gives it an experimental tug. 

“Here goes,” she announces, and does a show-offy aerial trick on the rope before inching her way up. 

As she does, the rope begins to ascend.

“Whoa!” she yelps, disappearing through the hole. 

Hanamir makes an elegant hop up to the middle of the rapidly-vanishing rope. In what looks like another impulsive decision, Harlan grabs on to the end of the rope before it slips out of reach. They pass through the ceiling one by one, leaving Tannin and Hermione downstairs with Magick, Buddy, and the panther.

The room upstairs is cavernous, and it somehow manages to smell even worse than the chamber below. Piles of bones and more human skins litter the floor. A huge shape emerges from the darkness. Its hands, the size of carriage wheels, toss the grappling hook and rope down through the hole in the floor. 

“I think this is an oni,” notes Hanamir. “A giant with certain polymorphic powers. You’ll note his clothing is fashioned from human skin, in accordance with oni tradition.”

“Fascinating, thank you,” says Harlan. 

At that, the oni roars something in Giant and blasts the three of them with a cone of freezing cold air, nearly killing them all in one blow.

“He says he just wanted to be left alone!” Hermione’s voice calls from downstairs. “Or that he just wanted to go for a swim! Those verbs sound really similar!” When no one responds, she calls again. “You guys okay up there?”

“Oh dang,” murmurs Tannin. He paces around the well beneath the opening in the ceiling. “That did not sound good. How do I get up there?”

“Don’t leave me alone down here!” says Hermione. “Not with the weirdos!”

“Hey, not cool. Buddy’s chill,” says Tannin. “But whatever, you want to try your luck? Sounds like they need reinforcements.”

“Yes!” she says. 

She evokes a cloud of mist at her feet and vanishes, reappearing in the upstairs chamber. She arrives not a moment too soon, as Hanamir, Harlan, and Galadriel are blue and shivering with hypothermia. The oni steps back, surprised by her sudden appearance.

“Desist, you mealy and flavorless dumpling!” she screams at it in Giant. She casts Ray of Sickness with an unprecedented burst of magical energy. The oni crumples on the spot, retching and heaving. 

This gives the others some time to recuperate. But the oni is enraged. Rounding on Hermione, it slashes her with an invisible blade, and the injury is critical. All four of the adventurers are on the ropes… which is what gives Hanamir the idea to lower another rope down for Tannin, who is now their last hope at survival.

“Yes!” cries Tannin, clambering up the rope. “I can feel a rage brewing! The kind that can only be sated by sending a stinking, good-for-nothing tumbletower crashing to the ground!”

He pops through the hole and immediately lands some devastating blows to the oni’s vital organs with his trident. 

“Heads up, Tannin,” says Galadriel, through chattering teeth. “I’m going to do Dissonant Whispers, and if it succeeds, he’s going to be compelled to flee as far away from me as possible.” 

“Roger that,” says Tannin.

Galadriel summons as much power as she can muster and casts the spell. Without warning, the oni disappears completely from view. 

“What?” Galadriel stutters. “That’s not part of the—”

The adventurers hear a splash from the room below. They circle around the opening in the floor and look down. A medium-sized humanoid shape has fallen into the well and is now mostly coated with the same shiny liquid that creeps over more and more of Harlan’s skin.

“How’d it get small like that?” says Tannin.

“Polymorphic powers!” chatters Hanamir. “Just as I thought!”

“And invisibility, too, I guess,” wheezes Harlan.

“Close one,” says Hermione, pale from blood loss. “Someone please go down and finish this.”

“On it!” says Tannin. 

He jumps down through the hole without considering the practical option of climbing back down the rope. The other adventurers hear some gruesome flesh-tearing noises mixed with a steady stream of truly tasteless anti-giant slurs.

“All done,” Tannin calls up at them. 

Slowly, the other four lower themselves down to join him. The dead oni has returned to its original, massive dimensions, and is still glistening with the substance from the well. 

“All right, enough’s enough,” says Harlan, landing heavily on the floor. “I’m casting Dispel Magic on whatever this stuff is.”

He casts the spell, and the silvery liquid slides off his arm like water into a puddle on the floor. 

“I still just wish I knew what it was!” he sighs. He stares, brow furrowed, at the giant corpse.

Galadriel looks around.

“Guys? Where did Buddy go? And Magick?” 

“And what about that panther?” says Hermione.

“Over in that corner, by the corridor,” says Hanamir. “Magick, are you all right?”

Magick’s eyes are shut and she is muttering something under her breath. She hits her head against the wall again and again. Next to her, Buddy sits quietly.

*What happened down here? Where’s the panther?* Galadriel thinks.

IT… I HAD TO TAKE CARE OF IT.

*What?! Did she see you?*

YEAH.

*Magick knows you’re a dragon?!*

YEAH.
