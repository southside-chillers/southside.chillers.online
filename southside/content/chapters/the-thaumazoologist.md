The adventurers huddle in the center of the empty orc temple. After [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/)’s discovery of the hollowed-out copy of Anatomy of Bugbears, Second Edition, they need to discuss their next move.

"We should see if we find anything else in the encampment nearby," says Hanamir. His face looks like the placid surface of the ocean above a deep-sea kraken fight. His fists are clenched; he’s almost daring the orc encampment to contain more defaced library books.

"Agreed," says [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) delicately. "But first, do we maybe want to search this place once more, in case we missed anything?"

"Yes, let’s just do it for peace of mind," says [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/). She smiles tentatively at Hanamir, who gazes into the middle distance.

They scour the temple top to bottom, and find shockingly few items of interest. There are zero religious texts devoted to Shargaas, no sacred implements, nothing in the way of sacrificial plunder, even. They just about call it a loss when, leaning on the altar, Harlan activates a well-hidden switch. The altar begins to swing sideways, and Harlan stands over a stone staircase leading down into a dark pit.

"Whoa," he says. A chilly air creeps up the staircase, making him shiver.

"Let’s check it out, I guess," says Galadriel. "With my blindsight, I can lead, if you want—"

"No need," says Hanamir, and he springs down the stairs in silence. Harlan and Galadriel follow in their usual formation.

The stairs lead down to a small cellar. It’s at least 15 degrees cooler than the temple and smells damp. The square of light above them illuminates two squalid, iron-barred cells: one is empty, and the other contains an elf woman shielding her eyes.

"Ow," she says, sounding hoarse. "I haven’t seen sunlight in days."

Galadriel’s ears perk up at the familiar voice, though she can’t quite place it. The elf woman’s soft blue hair is sectioned into disheveled plaits around her face. She squints up at the adventurers from the dirt floor, and Galadriel finally gets a good look at her. 

"[Hermione](/characters/hermione/)? Hermione Daydark?" Galadriel gasps. "It can’t be you! It’s been so long!"

"Galadriel?" says the elf woman slowly. "Silmion and Luthien Moonwater’s grandkid, right?"

"Yes!" squeals Galadriel. "From music class! I’m a bard now!"

"No way!" 

"Not to interrupt a reunion here, but who is this?" says Harlan, interrupting the reunion. "And what is she doing in an orcish jail cell?"

"I don’t know," says Hermione, the elf woman. "I woke up here, and I’m so confused. I’m just glad to see other people who don’t smell like" —she catches herself, noticing Hanamir— "um, like feet."

"Smells worse than feet! Smells like an orcish prison!" chuckles Galadriel. "Because that’s what it is!"

"Can you get me out of here? It’s locked pretty heavily, and my mind feels so fuzzy, I don’t remember any of my spells," laments Hermione. "I don’t have any of my things... not even my notebooks..."

"Yes, of course," says Galadriel. She tugs on the bars, testing them. "We probably don’t even need to use magic."

"Hold on, do we trust her?" says Harlan, glancing furtively at Galadriel. 

"Oh, yes, one hundred percent," says Galadriel. "I know her from home. She’s a Moon Elf, like me."

"That doesn’t necessarily mean..." starts Harlan, but Hanamir is already attempting to pick the lock. In the semidarkness, though, it’s hard for him to see what he’s doing. "Oh, fine, stand back, I’ll just use the hammer." 

Harlan smashes the lock. Galadriel offers a hand to Hermione, who steps out of the cell unsteadily. 

"Wow," she says, still blinking. "Thank you, all of you, so much. I’m Hermione. It’s very nice to meet you. What are your names?"

"I am Harlan, cleric of [Kord](/characters/kord/)," says Harlan, bowing deeply.

"Hanamir," says Hanamir. 

"I met them at [Fleck](/characters/fleck/)’s Tavern in Eillin some weeks ago," explains Galadriel. "We have been traveling companions ever since."

"Wonderful," says Hermione. "You know, of all our classmates, I suppose it makes sense that I’d run into you out in the world, in such diverse company." 

"Thanks, I think!" says Galadriel. "Hey, is that your stuff over there? Looks like they just locked it in the other cell." She points at a jumbled pile in the corner of the second cell. Harlan smashes the second lock. 

"Oh, thank goodness! My notebooks!" Hermione cries. "And the rest must belong to that gnome fellow who was here... a crossbow, some silver, and a letter..." 

"A gnome?" says Harlan.

"Yes, a nice little guy," says Hermione. "We talked for hours, or what seemed like hours, in the darkness. They removed him from his cell... I can’t say how long ago." 

She opens the letter. 

"It says it’s from Syndra to Rompit—ah, yes, Rompit, that was his name—and Syndra says, *‘Not to worrye; thinges are going fyne; but it’ll be a bit longer untylle I get home; Lookinge into a waye to bring back Dad.’*"

"Does that mean anything to you?" asks Harlan.

"Not really," says Hermione. "We mostly talked about, you know, what we’d regret most if we died in here."

"Understandable," says Galadriel. "But before we go, let’s make sure we’re not missing anything in here. We almost left the temple upstairs without finding you!"

Hermione shudders.

They search the cellar. Hanamir brushes some dust off one wall and uncovers a small seam, betraying the door to a wretchedly narrow crawlspace. None of them can see anything when they look inside; it appears to slope downward and become increasingly tiny.

"It’s in the direction of the sealed city," notes Hanamir.

"Could this be a way in?" wonders Harlan.

"A way in?" says Hermione, blanching. "Why would you be looking for a way in to the City of the Dead?"

"It’s a long story," says Hanamir, seeming to regain some of his earlier pep. "And we don’t have a reason to go in there yet, but we should revisit this once we explore the orc encampment. Hermione, does that interest you at all?"

"As long as it’s away from here!" She gives him a tight-lipped smile.

"Where were you headed, when you were captured by these orcs?" says Harlan. 

"I was researching magical creatures," she says, her eyes brightening. "It’s for my book. I was in pursuit of a very rare variety of unicorn sighted in this region when the orcs took me prisoner."

"That sounds fascinating," says Harlan. "I’d love to hear about your studies while we walk."

"Really? You’ll really take me with you?" says Hermione. She beams at them.

"We wouldn’t just leave you here!" scoffs Galadriel. "You’re one of my own! Come on."

The three adventurers lead Hermione, still a bit wobbly, up the stairs and back into the light of day.

The abandoned orc encampment is not much to look at. There’s a fire pit in the middle, now just a heap of ashes and rubble. There are a few small tents, each partially destroyed. There’s one larger tent that seems to have been intended for one person, presumably the leader. The camp may have supported fifteen to twenty orcs, tops.

In the ashes of the fire pit, Hermione spots something glimmering. She fishes it out. It’s a small gemstone, inscribed in a language none of them can understand. 

"This looks ancient," she says. "I think only a specialized scholar would be able to decipher this."

In the larger tent, Hanamir finds a singed scrap of paper that he immediately recognizes as being part of a book on Slaads.

"Oh! This was a good one. The Reproductive Cycle of the Slaad," he says. "Horrifying stuff."

He also finds a diagram pinned to one panel of the tent. It looks like a rudimentary map of the wall that surrounds the City of the Dead. The orcs had made a few markings around its perimeter.
 
"I wonder what these mean," he muses out loud. Resolving to figure it out, he rolls up the map and tucks it in his backpack.

Harlan finds an amulet very nearly obscured in the dirt. It resembles the Shargaas amulet the adventurers found early on in their journey, but this one has the symbol of an eye etched on it, rather than a crescent moon. He inspects it for a few moments before pocketing it.

"Trophies of false gods? That’s a bit Lolthian of you," Galadriel says, flashing an odd smile.

"Is that approval I’m hearing from you?" says Harlan. He gives her some serious side-eye and directs his attention at Hermione, who is familiarizing herself with some spells from one of the books found in her neighboring cell.

"All right," she concludes. "They’re not my usual fare, but I think I can whip up Modify Memory, Cordon of Arrows, Skywrite, and Dispel Evil and Good based on this book."

"Good," says Harlan. "We’ll need all the magic we can get."

"Yes... team, I think there’s nothing left for it," says Hanamir, staring out toward the forbidding black wall in the distance. "Let’s see what we can see of the sealed city."

---

As they approach the wall, the stench of decay grows stronger and stronger. There is no life in the shadow of the wall, nothing thriving, only the stillness of death. 

Harlan approaches the wall with caution.

"Guys?" he says. "This is weird."

"What’s weird?" says Galadriel.

"The wall is translucent up close," he says. "I can see the buildings inside—all abandoned, but looking...beautiful."

Galadriel approaches next.

"Oh wow," she says. "I can’t see through it, so I have no idea what you’re talking about, but wow I want to get in there."

"You can’t see them?" says Harlan.

"Nope. Can’t see nothing. Okay, let’s go in," says Galadriel.

"Hold up, wait, wait, hold on." Harlan grabs hold of her sleeve before she makes a running jump for the wall, presumably planning on spider-climbing it. "Please describe your feelings about the city in detail right now."

"Oh my god, why can’t I see it?" she says. "Is it cool?"

"Um, I guess," says Harlan. "It looks ancient, but not in disrepair or anything—very clean. No people. Just buildings made of marble. Very still."

"Sounds so good," says Galadriel. "Sounds like the museums are going to be sweet as hell."

Hermione joins them near the wall.

"Hm," she says. "I can’t see through it, either."

"Are you overwhelmed with the urge to go in?" says Harlan.

"No," shrugs Hermione.

"Okay, we’re going to step away from the wall for a bit, then," says Harlan, and he drags Galadriel back in the direction of Hanamir in the distance.

"You are the WORST, Harlan," she flails and struggles to break away toward the wall. "You don’t UNDERSTAND me and you’re always trying to murder my PIG—"

Harlan rolls his eyes and continues dragging her.

"She wants to go in the city!" he reports when they rejoin Hanamir. "She’s ensorcelled by something, as per usual!"

"I would like to enter the city as well," says Hanamir. 

"What?!" says Harlan.

"The trail of the books leads there," says Hanamir. "My code compels me to follow."

"But—but—should we not be better prepared? Would we not be served by a trip back to town first, before we enter the literal City of the Dead?!"

"Oh, sure, we can go back to town first," says Hanamir.

"I just think we need a plan, at least, before we rush in," says Harlan.

"Of course, that’s reasonable," says Hanamir. "Look, I’m just going to approach the wall, okay? I won’t do anything rash. I’d just like to check it out."

He walks closer and chucks a rock against the wall. (He’s got a great arm.) It bounces right off. 

"Did you learn anything?" says Harlan.

"Not really," says Hanamir. "But I can’t see through it either, and you can."

Harlan raises a hand to show the ring of the Been that [Frunk](/characters/frunk/) gave him before they left. 

"I wonder what happens if I take this off." He passes it to Hanamir and approaches the wall again. He returns, nodding. "Yes. It’s the ring."

The adventurers begin the trek back to Eillin. They get an extra-thorough patdown at the border, prompting some outrage from Hermione.

"Honestly, you’re no better than the orcs!" she tuts. "This is ridiculous."

"Standard protocol, ma’am," says a guard. "A prominent citizen was murdered not long ago. You’re lucky we don’t make you surrender your magical items."

"You wouldn’t dare," she sneers. The guards wave them through.

Back at the inn, the adventurers gather over pints of Fleck’s ale and some mediocre pub food. In hushed tones at their table, they discuss entering the City of the Dead.

"These books are my responsibility," says Hanamir. "If they are all destroyed, I must seek justice. If they are not all destroyed, I must recover them."

"I understand," says Harlan. He casts Augury, and a perfect miniature hurricane swirls from the center of the table under his hand. "Kord, I call on thee to answer me this: will a journey to the sealed city result in weal, or in woe?"

The voice of Kord crackles from the eye of the storm in four bursts:

*Weal.*

*Woe.*

*Woe.*

*Woe.*

The hurricane dissipates, and the four adventurers are left staring at their drinks.

"So," says Harlan. "About... that."

"There was some weal in there, though, right?" says Galadriel. She raises her glass. Hermione clinks with her, just happy to have had a shower and to be among friends in a well-lit tavern.

"Whether weal or woe awaits me," says Hanamir. "A man must have a code."
