After their night's rest, each member of the party finds that their dreams have come true! They all feel _amazing_ — not only well-rested, but measurably more proficient at a variety of skills important to them.

They decide to hit up the marketplace in town to do a little shopping, since they're in such a great mood. [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) decides he needs a new portable ram. His old one, he feels, is unlucky, and he spies a particularly gorgeous one that he simply must have. He doesn't have the gold for it, but the seller makes him a deal: if Tannin will run a series of grueling errands for him, the ram is his. Tannin agrees. He gives the party the red glass from the temple and goes on his way.

[Harlan](/characters/harlan/) has a hankering for a good bargain. He strikes up a conversation with another shopkeeper and purchases a magic orb that, when wielded, allows him to cast a cantrip of poison spray. He also buys a set of one thousand ball-bearings, which he gifts to [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/), just 'cause he's feeling generous. He inspects a ring inscribed with a "B." It's a little too pricey, however, so he leaves it alone.

Harlan, Hanamir, and [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) make their way back to Bryn's observatory to deliver the red glass. Bryn looks frazzled and sleep-deprived, but he's very excited to receive the glass. He says he'll get started right away on his machine, but it will take him 3 or 4 hours to complete it. 

Our heroes decide to head back toward the well to try and catch up with the missing townsfolk. On the way out of town, they encounter a human traveler. He looks world-weary, about 60 years old, and wears armor that he has modified himself. He's called the Savage, and he says he's on his way into Eillin for the Moon Festival, having just passed through the Town of the Undead. Hanamir notices that he's wearing a ring inscribed with a "B," just like the one from the marketplace. He also looks about half as old, when Hanamir really takes a good look at him. The ring doesn't seem to be magical, but when the Savage notices Hanamir's gaze, he tries to cover up his hand. When the group presses him on it, and mentions that there's a matching ring in town, he is unnerved and hurries away.

The party moves onward and makes it to the well. Galadriel yells down, but there's no response. They decide to go in and check. It looks just how they left it, but there's a spear on the ground in the first chamber. They proceed down the stairs and find that the grate in the floor has been moved. They can't see anything down there, even with darkvision.

Curiosity wins out. They decide to climb down into the narrow shaft, Hanamir going first, then Harlan, then Galadriel. There's a whole lot of nothing, until they're about 120 feet down, and then... Hanamir is caught! In a web! Of a giant spider!

Harlan lights his holy symbol, catching the spider's eyes. Galadriel shoots at the spider and misses, but casts Bardic Inspiration on Harlan to help him with close-range tasks. The spider attacks Hanamir, doing damage, but failing to poison him. Harlan tries to cut Hanamir free from the web but can't quite get it. He switches places on the rope with Galadriel, who tries slashing at the web with her rapier. Hanamir wriggles free! He climbs onto the spider's ledge.

Behind the spider, Hanamir can see 50 or 60 silk-wrapped shapes. He attacks the spider and misses. The spider shoots webbing at Galadriel, binding her against the wall. Harlan jumps down to the platform and attacks the spider with his maul in a heroic fashion that could only be described as “a natural 20." Hanamir follows up with a fatal blow, and the spider is no more.

They free Galadriel from the web and rescue the townspeople who were not yet spider chow. Galadriel is wracked with guilt for having led them here. In the spider's lair, the party finds 5 gold pieces each, as well as a pig. In her distress, Galadriel bonds with the pig immediately and decides to keep it as a pet. Harlan inspects the rest of the cave and throws an illuminated rock down the remainder of the shaft, but all seems empty. They leave the well, carrying the pig with them.

They journey back to town, having effectively killed a few hours on this mini quest. Galadriel now leads the pig on a leash. Hanamir has some skill in animal handling and decides to inspect the pig, and notices that it's heavier than a pig ought to be. He concludes it has consumed something of note. Though the idea of killing the pig is pitched, Galadriel protests in the strongest terms. Hanamir tries to give it a special pig Heimlich maneuver, but no dice. Galadriel serenades the pig with a traditional elven Song of Voiding, inducing the gentlest possible vomit in her dear new friend. The pig coughs up a magical gauntlet with the red spider insignia of the goddess Lolth. The gauntlet grants its wearer the power of blindsight and a spider-like climbing ability. Galadriel doesn't put it on, but keeps it.

Back at the observatory, Bryn presents the party with his newly-crafted pair of eel-brain-powered red glass goggles. He can see through the smoke with them, but he thinks it won't be enough to see the moon tonight. He asks if the party would be willing to take the goggles up to a mountaintop for a better view, or if not that, to extinguish the source of the smoke in the burning woods. Directing the goggles toward the woods, they can all see a tower of about 6 or 7 stories' height. 

Undecided on their next move, the party returns to the marketplace. Harlan asks the shopkeeper from that morning about the "B" ring he saw earlier, but the man is reluctant to acknowledge it. With some persuasion, he admits that he saw "the Savage" earlier and that he accepted a large sum of money for the ring. He implies that the ring may have been stolen from the grave of a man known around town as Uncle. The shopkeeper recalls Uncle's address was 1122 Boogie Woogie Avenue, but he had no relatives, and there's another family living there now.

The party heads to 1122 Boogie Woogie Avenue. While Galadriel asks the man of the house what he knows about Uncle, Hanamir sneaks around the side and breaks into the cellar. He sees casks of ale, old farming tools, and some books about the town. On the bookshelf, he notices "TANNIN WAS HERE!" carved into the wood. He chuckles, knowing that despite having separate adventures today, somehow his friend's penchant for bookshelf destruction led him to the same place. He decides not to steal anything, and sneaks back out. 

Galadriel learns that 1122 Boogie Woogie Avenue was a frequent meeting place for Uncle and his group of friends, including Mayor Frunk, and that after his death, the group would sometimes come back to the house to honor Uncle's memory. Hanamir, hearing this, reconsiders. He sneaks back into the basement and steals the most informative book. He comes back around front, looking eager to leave, and the group bids the man farewell. They decide to take another rest before deciding what their next move should be.
