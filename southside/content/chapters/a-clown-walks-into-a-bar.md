[Tannin](/characters/tannin/) searches the bodies of the two suspects lying on the pavement. He doesn’t find much. 

“These guys have maybe six copper pieces between them,” he reports. “Nothing in their pockets. Actually, these might not even be pockets. Just holes.”

[Chunk](/characters/chunk/) is clearly uncomfortable as the third suspect struggles against his grip, but his hog-wrasslin’ skills prove effective at restraining the individual. [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) pulls his mask off and sees that he’s a human man, perhaps in his late twenties, who looks terrified that he will soon meet the same fate as his two compatriots.

“Where were you going in such a hurry?” Harlan asks. 

“We—we were just told to check out the site and leave—that’s all we were told to do,” says the young man.

“Told by whom?” asks Harlan.

“I… I… I don’t…” he trails off.

“What is your name?”

“My name is Tord,” says the man. “I swear, I don’t even know who hired us—”

“We have no desire to kill you,” says Harlan. “You can walk away from this if you give us all the information you have about the disaster that just took place here.”

“I don’t know anything!” yelps Tord. “I can take you back to where we were going, if you want—where they told us to meet for the payment…”

“Who told you to meet for what payment?” asks Tannin, finally giving up on sorting through the nondescript rags on the two bodies on the ground.

“I don’t know his name,” says Tord.

“Is it the Messenger?” Harlan hazards a guess.

“Do you… do you follow him?” asks Tord, his tone changing.

“We’re interested in his teachings,” says Harlan. He nods at Chunk, who lets go of Tord’s arms and sets him free.

Tord makes an odd gesture, like an L-shape with one hand, raised to his face. His entire demeanor changes, and he relaxes as he begins to lead them out of the Flats and back toward the Kiln.

“You’re not from around here, I can tell,” says Tord. “How did the word of the Messenger reach you?”

“We only found out about him as we arrived in Aberith,” says Harlan. “We’ve been working in service to the king.”

“The king serves false gods,” Tord says. There is a surprising sting in his voice.

“That’s what we’ve heard, too,” says Harlan, with a significant look at Tannin. “We’re looking for others with influence in the city to parlay with, if you happen to know any.”

Tord leads them onward in the darkness through the narrow streets. 

“It’s cool that people as different as you all have found the word of the Messenger,” he says, with a curious look at Chunk. Chunk nods at him, and Tord turns away quickly.

“So, who are the true gods, then?” asks Tannin.

“They all died,” says Tord, eyes wide. “That’s what the Messenger teaches.”

The streets become emptier and quieter as they approach the Kiln.

[Hermione](/characters/hermione/) sits in her room at the Half-Full Flagon. Her eyes scan the page of the book she’s reading—*Fifty-Five Things You Wish You Knew About Battling the Undead*, by one of her all-time favorite authors, Brunhilde Snapdragon—but she finds herself reading the same sentence over and over. She can’t stop thinking about the explosion and the unnatural ruin it left behind. 

“Hello,” comes a voice from behind her chair, nearly causing her to fall out of it. [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) has appeared in the room without so much as a creaking floorboard to betray his entrance.

“Oh, it’s just you,” she murmurs, hand over her heart. “How was [Kandir](/characters/kandir/)’s house? And where’s [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/)?”

“She’s right behind me,” says Hanamir. “We had to escape some Amber Guardsmen, and since I have the quiznos, I used some of my extra skills to make a swifter exit.”

“And the house?” presses Hermione, shutting her book.

“Mixed results, I’m afraid,” says Hanamir. “We found a note from Jao Vedit thanking Kandir for getting him out of a tight spot financially. We also found investigative materials about members of the Anti-Magic League.”

“That sounds promising!” says Hermione.

“Yes, but…” 

Before Hanamir can break the bad news, Galadriel’s footsteps can be heard stomping up the stairs and down the hallway toward their room. She appears in the doorway a moment later, breathless, clutching a bag that is, unsettlingly, hovering by itself and emitting incessant, angry chirps.

“Help,” wheezes Galadriel. “Hermione, this bird… we found it in his library… I think… it’s a clairvoyance thing… and it saw us…”

“Ah,” says Hermione, glancing at Hanamir.

Galadriel fumbles opening her bag, and Kandir’s little bird squawks and bursts out of her hands, flying in circles around the room.

“A finch,” says Hermione. “All right, let’s see. I think I have an idea.” She casts Find Familiar, and a second identical finch appears on her shoulder, pecking at her earring curiously. “I’ll talk to it through my familiar here.”

They watch as Hermione’s bird tweets a short song to Kandir’s bird, who chirps loudly in response.

“It says it’s frightened,” says Hermione. “And says it wants to go home.”

“Aw, man,” says Galadriel. She sinks into a chair and begins catching her breath.

The birds chirp at each other some more. 

“It says it misses its friend—I asked who its friend was—” Hermione translates. “It says ‘the tall man.’”

“Kandir is tall!” cries Galadriel.

“But what is tall, to a bird that lives indoors?” muses Hanamir. “I imagine Tannin could seem tall.”

“I’m trying to reassure this bird we’ll bring it back to Kandir,” says Hermione, through a flurry of birdsong. “It’s totally freaking out. Why did you take it from the house?!”

“I didn’t know what it was! I thought it might have been a clairvoyance device!” says Galadriel.

“You know what? I’ll double check,” says Hermione, reconsidering. She casts Detect Magic, and the usual magical suspects glow before her eyes—her familiar, Galadriel’s gauntlet, Hanamir’s boots—but there are two more enchanted objects in the room she hadn’t expected. Both Kandir’s bird and Galadriel’s eyeballs radiate a soft light.

“It’s a familiar, too!” says Hermione, eyes widening. “And Galadriel, it’s not just your right eye—it’s *both* eyes that are under some kind of spell.”

“Uh oh,” says Galadriel. 

“I’m going to dismiss these two,” says Hermione.

“But if it’s Kandir’s familiar, he’ll still be able to access its memories, even after it’s dismissed,” says Hanamir. “Right?”

“Yes,” says Hermione. She sighs and casts Dispel Magic, and the two finches blink out of existence. “But I’m more concerned about the spy in our own midst now.”

She and Hanamir both turn to Galadriel.

“So he told you to meet him here?” says Tannin. Tord has led them through the Kiln to an establishment called the Outcast. Its exterior is covered in enchanted neon lights advertising billiards, dice games, and the presence of ladies.

“Yeah, for the rest of the payment,” says Tord. 

“How much? And what did he look like?” asks Harlan.

“I don’t know,” says Tord.

Harlan rolls his eyes.

“Try and get anything useful from him,” he says, turning to Tannin. “I’m going to talk to the proprietor.”

He approaches the front desk, where a goblin with a gold tooth shuffles through piles of parchment.

“Sir, can you direct me to the person in charge of this establishment?” asks Harlan, sidling up to the goblin’s side. 

“You’re talking to him,” says the goblin without diverting his gaze from the task at hand. “The name is Slax.”

“Great,” says Harlan. He sets five silver coins down on the desk.  “I was wondering if you could take a look at the young man sitting over there, right by the dwarf with the trident and the big blue farm boy, and tell me if you’ve seen him around here before.”

Slax looks up, impressed by neither the coins nor the description of the individuals. He follows Harlan’s outstretched finger toward where Tord sits, flanked by Tannin and Chunk, sipping an ale out of a rusty-looking cup.

“If I sold out my clientele for five silver, I would not have much of an establishment here,” says the goblin. He looks back down at his papers, not bothering to make eye contact with Harlan at all.

“Of course, of course, nothing’s free in this world,” says Harlan. “But just so you know, my associates and I have connections to the king, and…”

Slax gives Harlan a sharp look, then lifts a flap on his cloak to reveal several jagged blades beneath it. 

“Oh, there’s no need for violence,” says Harlan, backpedaling. “I didn’t mean—”

“How about you ask me your question, and I write down a number?” says Slax.

“Sounds great,” says Harlan. “All right, the guy I pointed to. Who is he, and who are his associates?”

Slax takes a quill and tears off a piece of parchment from his scroll. He neatly writes “one gold” on the parchment and slides it across the desk to Harlan.

“Perfect,” says Harlan, who had secretly been worried the ransom would be prohibitively high. He digs in his pocket for a gold coin and passes it to Slax, who snaps it away in a multi-locked pouch at his waist.

“Never seen him before in my life,” he deadpans, turning back to his papers.

“Ah,” says Harlan, face falling. “Understood.”

He turns to go. As if taking pity on him, Slax says something as soon as his back is turned.

“We don’t get guys like that in here often,” he offers.

“Guys like what?” asks Harlan.

“Just… look around. The gambling, the dice? The dancing girls? People here tend to have the money to spend on these things.”

“I see,” says Harlan. “Thanks.”

He sits back down with Tannin, Chunk, and Tord, sounding resigned.

“So you have no idea who you were supposed to meet here, then?” he asks.

“No, I was just given a time,” says Tord.

“What?!” asks Harlan. “What time? Did you not think we’d want to know that?”

“Midnight,” says Tord, only pausing briefly to speak before returning to his ale.

Harlan rolls his eyes again and looks at Tannin and Chunk, who give him sympathetic looks, like “this guy, what are you gonna do?”

They each finish a drink and are on their second round by the time the clock strikes midnight. And at first, when Harlan sees the figure who crosses the threshold, he thinks maybe he’s had too much. But no, he’s not imagining things: the person who walks through the door of the Outcast is dressed as a clown.

As soon as the clown enters, he turns around and leaves.

“He saw something he didn’t like,” says Harlan. “Quick. We need to follow him.”

“I have an idea!” says Chunk. 

Without fanfare, he morphs into a little black cat and scampers out of the bar into the night after the clown.

---

The room at the Half-Full Flagon is plenty cramped by the time Harlan and Tannin arrive with Tord, joining Galadriel, Hanamir, and Hermione.

“Who’s this?” asks Hanamir, glancing at the new face.

“This is Tord,” says Harlan. “We found him fleeing the scene of the explosion, and he led us to a game parlor called the Outcast where he was told to await his payment.”

“Oh, I’ve been there,” says Galadriel. “That place is kind of gross, and I say that not just because of its rivalry with the Black Unicorn—”

“Shh! Payment for what?” says Hermione, horrified. “For… doing the explosion?”

“Apparently not,” says Harlan. “Just for passing information about the scene at ground zero back to some mysterious person who hired him off the street.”

“And wait ‘til you hear about the person who hired him!” Tannin says. “It’s a *clown*!”

“Wait, back up,” says Galadriel.

Patiently, Harlan and Tannin walk Hermione, Hanamir, and Galadriel through their evening with Tord and their clown sighting at the Outcast, concluding with Chunk’s shape-shifting into a cat in pursuit of the clown.

“Sorry, who is Chunk?” asks Hanamir.

“Oh, that’s right,” says Harlan. “Forgive me, it’s been a long night. Chunk is Elris’s son. He took care of Zotz during our trip to the Northern Ruins, and he’s my apprentice now. He’ll meet us back here.”

“Cool,” says Galadriel. She bites her lip. “So… want to hear about our night?”

“Yes,” says Tannin. “I swam past Hanamir in the river earlier and he said things had broken bad a little at Kandir’s house. Everything okay?”

“Kind of,” she says. Hermione stares at her. “I mean, not really.”

“Yes, Galadriel,” says Hermione pointedly, “tell them what you stole from Minister Kandir’s house, and how many of your eyes are cursed.”

“A bird,” says Galadriel. “And both.”

Hanamir explains the situation to Tannin, Harlan, and Tord (who displays a marked lack of interest). The party then takes a moment to consider their collective situation in silence.

“How much time do we have before [Pouru](/characters/pouru/)’s execution?” Hermione wonders out loud.

“Not much, I bet,” says Harlan. “Executions are usually at dawn, right?”

“That doesn’t give us long to skip town,” says Hanamir.

“Skip town?” says Galadriel.

“Yes, after Kandir’s familiar saw our faces,” says Hanamir. “It’s only a matter of time before he knows we were in his house.”

“But really, how much can that bird even tell him?” says Galadriel. “The best it could do at describing Kandir himself was calling him ‘the tall man.’ So he reports a big toothy guy and a blonde lady took him from his cage; so what?”

At that moment, Chunk knocks at the door and peeks inside. 

“I tracked him all the way to a different tavern across the Kiln,” he reports, sounding somewhat winded. “A place called the Upstanding Gentleman.” 

“Oh!” says Harlan. “We know that place. That’s where someone tried to buy the basilisk corpse off us, remember?”

“It looked, kind of, um,” says Chunk, “scary in there.”

“That’s the place,” nods Tannin. 

“You ever been there, Tord?” asks Harlan.

Tord shakes his head, back to being unhelpfully tight-lipped. 

“And you didn’t know you were waiting for a clown?” clarifies Hanamir, struggling to make sense of the story.

“No, I didn’t know it’d be a clown. They just told me to wait there and someone would come to me.” Tord shrugs. “I needed the money.”

“Listen,” says Tannin, the gleam of an idea fresh in his eyes. “We might have a job for you. What do you say to being a custodian at one of our fine rental properties?”

“How much is the pay?” says Tord.

“Our rates are competitive and negotiable,” says Tannin. “Our property manager, H’Jun, can give you the details—”

“Okay, hold up, before we hire a janitor for [Shinebright](/characters/shinebright/)’s tower, do you all want to take a rest?” says Harlan.

“I don’t think we have time,” says Hermione, “if we’re planning on talking to Pouru before she’s done for.”

“Yes, we must forgo sleep for the sake of the truth,” concludes Hanamir. 

“All right,” says Harlan. “Tord, you stay here. I’m leaving you some copper for as many drinks as you could possibly want at the bar downstairs. Just don’t leave, okay?”

“Sounds good to me,” says Tord. He gives Harlan a curt bow.

The adventurers file out of the room and down the stairs, out into the night once more.

For this time of night, there’s a surprising amount of activity at the bridges that separate Aberith’s uptown from its downtown. The explosion seems to have triggered a surge in would-be commuters from lower Aberith to the posh neighborhoods of the north side, but the guards manning the bridges are having none of it.

“Travel between Rivergate and Silver Hill is temporarily barred!” one guard shouts over the noise of the crowds. “Please understand, our hands are tied here! Aberith is in a state of emergency!”

The adventurers huddle, standing at a distance from the bridge.

“I have a really good idea, you guys,” says Galadriel.

“You’ve had a couple of those tonight,” Hanamir says apprehensively.

“No, but this one is *really* good,” says Galadriel. She pulls the hood of her cloak over her face and mumbles something under her breath, and when she emerges, she is wearing the rather stunning face of the Minister of Justice, Kir [Mirama](/characters/mirama/).

“First the bird, and now this?” says Hanamir, uncharacteristically peeved. “Galadriel, don’t forget, there are anti-magic obelisks uptown.” 

“We’ll only need the spell to work as far as the bridge,” says Galadriel, admiring her newfound beauty in a compact mirror. “We need to get past the guards, and then we’re free to go wherever.” 

Hanamir looks at the other adventurers for backup, but they stare at Galadriel, considering it.

“Listen, I know Mirama,” says Tannin, “and I can’t tell it’s not her right now.”

“Yes, it’s definitely better than that time you disguised yourself as Pouru to break us out of prison,” says Hermione.

Hanamir stews silently as the other adventurers prepare for the grift, psyching themselves up to be believable associates of the Minister of Justice. (In the absence of ideas on this front, Chunk simply transforms into a mouse and climbs onto Harlan’s shoulder.)

“Good evening,” Galadriel addresses a guard, flanked by her entourage. “I understand your orders under the circumstances of tonight’s events, but I would respectfully ask that you let me return these guests of the King to their quarters uptown.”

“Oh,” says a young guard, wide-eyed. “Um, I don’t know if I have the authority to… let me get my manager.”

He brings two more seasoned-looking guards over, and all three of them squint in the darkness at Galadriel’s face. She stares back at them evenly.

“Right this way, Minister,” says one of them, bowing. “All these folks with you? The, uh, the half-orc too?”

“Yes,” says Galadriel. “Thank you, sir, and thank you for your service to Aberith on this terrible day for our city.”

“It’s an honor, ma’am,” says the guard.

The adventurers file through the small gap in the barricade and over the bridge.

The uptown neighborhood of Silver Hill is swarming with Amber Guardsmen—more, in fact, than the adventurers had thought existed in toto. They are hard at work fortifying structures and boarding up windows, as if preparing for a riot.

“Seems like a weird use of resources on a night like tonight,” whispers Harlan.

As they pass the obelisk near the prison, Galadriel turns back into herself. The prison is entirely unguarded, and they have no trouble sneaking inside and making their way back to the cell where the former Minister of War sleeps in a pile of rags. She opens her eyes blearily and sits up at the sound of their approach.

“You’re back,” she rasps. “Why?”

Harlan makes the Sign of the Lightning.

“I am here to give you your last rites,” he says. 

Pouru nods and sinks back to the floor.

“Not a follower of [Kord](/characters/kord/) myself,” she whispers, “but go ahead.”

Instead of delivering a final blessing, however, Harlan casts Remove Curse. A shadow lifts from Pouru’s hunched form, as if Harlan has dusted off a layer of ash from her skin, and it dissolves in the air above her. She turns back to him, clear-eyed and fully awake, breathing deeply.

“General Pouru,” says Harlan. “We have some questions for you.”
