During the night, [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) has a dream.

He is in the cave he once protected. He relishes the scents of the mineral stream and the petrichor in the air filling his lungs for the first time in so long. But it’s not just the comfort of being home; there’s something else he’s feeling… a new confidence, an expansiveness of self that feels exhilarating. A storm roils outside the cave. The percussive sound, the electrifying light—he can feel it all, and it’s coming from within him. 

As another crash of thunder reverberates through him, *from* him, Harlan understands: he is the most powerful being on the planet. He rules over the material plane. He is the slayer of Kord. 

He wakes up, heart pounding, to the eerie silence of the inn. He struggles to shake off the feeling the dream left him with and go back to sleep, but finds it impossible. He decides to get out of bed and volunteer for the next shift. At least then [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) can get some rest.

“Thanks, man,” whispers Tannin as they trade places. “He hasn’t come out yet.” Tannin glances down at the bear trap a little ruefully.

Across the hall, [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) sleeps on his back, straight as a board, tightly tucked into his blankets. His face is perfectly neutral. You might not be able to tell by looking at him that he’s deep in a dream about his favorite place in the world, Drephis State.

He is finally home! And he has restored the missing library books—and then some. The library is now the pride of the school, and it’s all thanks to Hanamir’s dedication and diligence. The student body names a school holiday for him. After a long day of receiving thanks and praise from his colleagues, Hanamir retires to the library for his usual pre-bedtime book inventory check. Nothing brings him more satisfaction than seeing all his books in their proper place, neatly organized and cared for. But out of the corner of his eye, he spots a terrifying figure in blood red robes. It clutches a black book bearing a demonic seal. Upon detection, the creature makes eye contact with Hanamir for a split second. He wakes up, bolting upright out of bed.

Unnerved, Hanamir paces quietly around the room, careful not to wake the small, sleeping figure in the other bed. He figures now’s as good a time as any to go take his turn on watch. 

Meanwhile, [Hermione](/characters/hermione/) has finally managed to tune out [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/)’s aggressive snoring and fall asleep. She, too, has a dream.

She is out in the wilderness, having just discovered some fascinating material for her book on magical creatures. She is certain that it’s shaping up to be another bestseller, perhaps her finest work yet. There are only a few more rare beasts that elude her, but if she can be patient and follow her instincts, the creatures she’s waiting for might just come to her….

“There are secrets that even the gods do not know,” comes a voice from behind her. She whips around, spooked, and sees a strange figure with long stone spikes on its back and a single bright eye. It is a Nothic—not one of the creatures she’d been planning to write about, but uncommon and intriguing nonetheless. Nothics were once wizards, transformed and corrupted by the pursuit of magical secrets.

Before she can respond, the Nothic makes a strange motion (a nonverbal spell, perhaps) and disappears into what Hermione can only assume is the Shadowfell.

She wakes up, feeling a mixture of fear and curiosity… and with that curiosity, some shame. She decides to take the next watch.

As Hermione leaves the room, she sees Galadriel sleeping sprawled on her stomach with her face contorted in what looks like unspeakable pain. [Buddy](/characters/buddy/) is nestled in the warmth of her armpit. She whimpers in between snores. 

Galadriel dreams that she has found [Magick](/characters/magick/), and by accident, too. She stumbled across a hidden cellar door while searching for a bathroom and discovered the elusive tiefling inside. Magick has her back turned and is leaning over a table. Flashes of light, accompanied by agonized screaming, periodically illuminate the cellar.

She can’t see what’s on the table, but her stomach drops to the floor with a horrible feeling that it’s someone she loves.

“Please, no!” she cries. “Stop! Don’t hurt him!”

An invisible force field holds her in place. She wants to run forward and tackle Magick, or shoot an arrow at her back, but she can’t move. All she can do is speak.

“Magick, please,” she sobs as another round of screaming begins. “He’s good. I know he’s good.”

A thought worms its way into her mind, its origin unclear. If she says a single word, she can put an end to this. She can kill Magick to save this person she loves. And she knows she has to do it. 

She speaks the word. Magick turns around and stares at her, then freezes—and falls to the floor, dead. An overwhelming relief floods through Galadriel’s body. She rushes to the table to comfort the creature, still weeping, but knowing at last that it is safe. Everyone she loves is safe.

Galadriel wakes, shivering and sweaty. Buddy licks her face a little, and she smiles. 

“What a scary dream,” she murmurs to him. “Stay cozy. I’m gonna go take my turn keeping watch. Love you, Buddy boy.”

Back in Harlan and Tannin’s room, Harlan is having a hard time getting back to sleep. Tannin is dreaming, uh, loudly: mumbling, thrashing, and punching the air in his sleep.
 
Tannin stands on a desolate battlefield. A sulphurous wind stings his eyes and tangles his hair and beard. An army of giants—fire giants, frost giants, hill giants, cloud giants—is closing in on him, and he’s never felt more alive. He grips his trident and swivels, pointing it at each of them in turn. He wants them all to get a good look at the magnificent weapon that will be ending their lives in short order.

“Ha-HAAAAAA!” he bellows, and this prompts the first giant to charge at him. Tannin strikes him down easily, and quickly flies into a rage-filled frenzy, toppling giants one after the other. 

Soon the only one left is the leader, the largest giant of them all, a storm giant. In a language Tannin can’t understand, it begs for its life. 

“Sorry, big guy,” says Tannin. “You messed with the wrong dwarf.” And he throws down his trident and clobbers him to death with his bare hands.

He wakes up with a smile and a sigh, wishing the dream could have lasted longer. He can hear Harlan mutter, “Oh thank Kord,” and assumes he must have been making a lot of noise. *Worth it*, thinks Tannin, rolling over. He stays in bed, replaying the dream in his head. 

At this point, the night has given way to a dim pre-dawn haze. Hermione still struggles to get back to sleep, her mind racing and her bed feeling uncomfortable in every respect. She finally gives up and goes out into the hallway to sit with Galadriel.

“Can’t sleep,” she whispers.

“Ugh,” Galadriel whispers back. “I slept for awhile, but had the worst dream.”

“Really? I had a creepy dream, too,” Hermione says. “I wonder if it’s something about this place.”

“Wouldn’t be surprised,” says Galadriel. They sit together in silence, staring at the bear trap, then [the Savage](/characters/the-savage/)’s door, then the ceiling, wishing the sun would hurry up and rise already. 

“Want to go see if the boys are awake, too?” says Hermione.

“Sure,” says Galadriel. They approach Harlan and Tannin’s door and tap on it lightly, quiet enough not to wake them if they’re asleep, but loud enough to alert them if they’re already up.

Harlan answers the door, looking mildly cranky.

“Can’t sleep? Weird dreams?” he asks.

“Yes,” says Hermione. 

“My dream wasn’t weird,” says Tannin.

“Let’s check on Hanamir,” says Galadriel. “I want to know what was up with his backpack.”

They follow the same knocking protocol at Hanamir’s door. He opens it a crack, sees it’s them, and lets them in. They all immediately notice the tiny, withered old man who is tucked neatly into the second bed, blinking up at them. 

“This,” says Hanamir, “is [Redyl](/characters/redyl/).”

“How do you do,” says the elderly gnome. He looks like a white-bearded baby in a bed far too large for him.

“Pleasure to meet you, Redyl,” says Harlan, bowing. “Hanamir, what happened? The orcs pushed him forward as they went through the portal, and there was this flash of light, and then you were both gone…”

“Yes, I spirited him away for just a moment,” says Hanamir. “Wanted to have a word with him outside the earshot of our friend the Savage, whom I believe to be magically compromised.” He pauses a moment. “Redyl, do you mind if I tell them what you shared with me?”

“Please,” says Redyl.

“He told me he’d been held by the orcs for a long time, and that they’d forced him to bring them through the Shadowfell to the City of the Dead. The orcs had been collecting various tuning forks, and once they had the ones they needed for the spell, they coerced Redyl into doing their bidding. They told him they had his children captive,” says Hanamir.

“Oh, how terrible,” says Hermione. “I’m so sorry, Redyl.”

Redyl bows his head.

“Redyl believes that the orcs ultimately wish to slay the gods,” continues Hanamir. “We’ve heard inklings of this from the Shargaasians, who want to take down Gruumsh in particular. But this sounds like it is a much broader effort than just that.”

Harlan remembers his dream and how good he felt being the slayer of Kord. He feels the hairs on the back of his neck stand up.

“Anyway, I told him what I suspect about the Savage, and asked him to get in my backpack so that I could transport him with us in secrecy. He agreed, and was an excellent sport about it,” says Hanamir.

“Oh, it was plenty roomy for me,” says Redyl with a tiny chuckle. “And I was very glad to be out of the company of [Khargol](/characters/khargol/) and his men.”

“I also told him that whatever is going on with his kids, whether that threat was real or not, we will do what we can to help him,” says Hanamir.

“Of course,” says Galadriel. “I can’t imagine how terrifying this has been for you, Redyl.”

“Hey,” says Hermione, pulling a letter from her pocket. “I was imprisoned with the Shargaasians myself for awhile, and my cellmate was a gnome named Rompit, and he left this letter—”

“Rompit?!” cries Redyl, almost forgetting to keep his voice down. “Rompit is my son!”

“Really?” Hermione beams.

“Yes. It is almost a comfort to know that they really did have my son. At least I was truly protecting him when I submitted to their evil will,” Redyl sighs.

“The letter was from someone named Syndra—”

“That’s my daughter!” Redyl is overcome with emotion. Galadriel offers him her handkerchief. 

“They were looking for you,” says Hermione. She skims the letter, which she almost knows by heart. “Syndra wrote to Rompit saying that everything was going fine, but that it would take her a bit longer to get home. She said she was looking for a way to bring back Dad.”

Redyl cries into the handkerchief, which is the size of his entire body, while Galadriel rubs his back.

“Sorry,” he hiccups, and calms himself down. “Here’s what I know: the orcs have been collecting some very rare artifacts that are necessary for planar travel. Some of them were the tuning forks Hanamir mentioned; some of them were—I think—smuggled out of a university. They had people trying to make new ones. Eventually, they found what they needed to get here. They came here to enlist someone’s help, but I don’t know whose. I assume it’s all a part of this plot to slay the gods.”

“Thank you, Redyl,” says Hanamir. “Harlan, how has your connection to Kord been feeling since we entered the city? Among the group of us, you have the closest relationship to a god who might be threatened by this.” 

Harlan considers this. He feels guilty, somehow, even though he knows he hasn’t actually done anything to betray his deity.

“I feel… strangely disconnected from Kord here,” says Harlan. “There’s just this emptiness. I’m still able to cast my spells. But it feels odd, and—wrong. Everything is just *off* here.” He’s quiet for a minute. “And that reminds me. Galadriel, I meant to ask you about what was going on in the throne room, when you let Buddy out and then looked like you were about to faint.”

“Oh yeah!” says Tannin. “I was sure whatever had gotten the Savage had gotten you too.”

“It wasn’t that,” says Galadriel. “Okay, this is going to sound insane, and I haven’t been sure how to phrase it,” she says. “But Buddy talked to me. In my head.”

“Like, telepathically?” says Hermione. “Your pig is telepathic?”

“I don’t know,” sighs Galadriel. “I guess so.”

They wait for her to elaborate, but she doesn’t.

“So what’d he say?” says Tannin, [weirded out](https://youtu.be/uV8TcpRQJCM?t=44s).

“He warned me not to let anyone sit on the throne,” she says. “He said there’s a Lich in the city, and that we weren’t safe.”

“And you waited until *now* to let us in on that little tidbit?!” whispers Harlan through gritted teeth.

“Hanamir waited until now to tell us he had the gnome!” says Galadriel. “I wanted to talk to you all together, and not in front of the Savage. Besides, it only confirms what we already suspected.”

“Can we talk to him now?” says Hermione.

“We can try,” says Galadriel. “I don’t know how it works.”

She crosses the hallway and retrieves the little pink pig. She returns, stifling giggles as he sniffs her neck and nibbles softly on her earlobe.

“Should we entice him with something? Some, I don’t know, slop?” Hermione wonders.

“Ew, no,” says Galadriel. “He eats what I eat.”

“Okay, so think something at him,” says Tannin. Galadriel does so.

*Hi, Buddy. My friends are wondering if you’d be willing to talk to us.*

The same sourceless, soundless voice enters her mind.

HI GALADRIEL. YES, I COULD TALK. BUT I WORRY IT’S NOT THE BEST IDEA.

*Why not?*

I THINK THE MORE I REVEAL OF MYSELF, THE MORE LIKELY IT IS THAT THE LICH WILL CATCH ON THAT I’M NOT WHAT I APPEAR TO BE.

*Is he watching us right now?*

HE IS EVERYWHERE IN THIS CITY.

Galadriel takes a moment to relay this information to her friends. 

“Oh, great,” says Harlan. Galadriel turns back to Buddy.

*So what would happen if he found out what you really are?*

IT WOULD BE BAD. FOR ME AND FOR ALL OF US. OUR PEACEFUL PASSAGE THROUGH THE CITY MIGHT END ABRUPTLY.

*Do you know how to defeat him?*

NO. BUT I CAN FEEL HIS PRESENCE, AND I AM AFRAID.

*Okay. Thank you, Buddy. You don’t have to talk anymore.*

She gives him a cuddle and summarizes his concerns back to the adventurers. They are silent for a good long while as they turn this information over in their heads.

“So,” says Hanamir. “It sounds like we should get out of the city.”

“And we have to either take the Savage’s ring, or get him into a state where we can safely bring him out with us without also bringing along the Lich, or some sort of interplanar demon, or whatever is possessing him,” says Harlan.

“You can use Dispel Magick, right?” asks Hanamir. Harlan nods. “We should try casting it on the Savage before he leaves his room, and then going to talk to him to see if it worked.”

“Before we do that,” says Galadriel, “I want to take the chance, while we’re all sharing stuff, to ask Tannin where the hell he’s been.”

“Oh yeah!” says Tannin. “Ha, I forgot I hadn’t already explained this. Well, that potion I drank was supposed to be a plane-shifting potion, but we know Magick is kind of terrible at potions, right? So I figured maybe it’d heal me or something, because I was cut up pretty bad in that Lolth tower,” he reminisces. “Anyway, it didn’t, and it didn’t take me back to her hut like she said, either.”

“Did it take you to the ocean?” Hermione makes an educated guess.

“It wasn’t just the ocean,” says Tannin. “It was an entire plane of water. There was no surface. I thought for sure I was going to die, like, right away.” He laughs. “But then this strange creature saved me, and took me in, and taught me in his mysterious foreign ways. He taught me how to breathe underwater, and it was lucky that he could do that in under a minute. Otherwise, you know.” He mimes clutching at his throat and drowning. “And not only that, he also had information about what happened to my clan. The darkness that seeped in and took everything I knew.”

“Wait, what?” says Galadriel. “You’ve never mentioned that before.”

“I’m a very private person,” says Tannin.

“More a man of action than of words, it’s true,” Hanamir says. 

“Yeah, exactly. So I stayed there in his temple for what seemed like years. I can speak Aquan now. And they taught me some great tricks. You saw what I did with the icicle back there, but that’s just the beginning.”

“How did you leave? And how did you find us?” asks Harlan.

“That was all you, dude,” says Tannin. “The Genasi—the underwater people—told me that Kord was summoning me to come back to this plane in your time of need.”

“Whoa, nice going, Kord!” says Galadriel.

“Praise Kord, indeed,” says Harlan. He smiles. It feels good knowing that even if he’s disconnected from Kord at the moment, the god himself is still looking out for him.

“Wanna see me breathe underwater?” says Tannin.

“Duh,” says Galadriel.

Tannin takes his water flask and empties it into his mouth while pinching his nose. He then spends the next five minutes striking poses with his trident and gesturing at how not-drowned he is.

“Was it hard to swim with that?” says Hermione.

“Nah, I learned to move around all right. And it definitely came in handy when this weird monster made of mouths appeared and I had to kill it.”

Harlan, Galadriel, and Hanamir look at each other and wordlessly decide it’s not worth explaining that right now.

“Well, it’s good to have you back,” says Hanamir. “Redyl, it might be time for you to hop back in my backpack. Sorry about that. But we’ll be leaving soon, I think.”

“No trouble at all, Mr. Hanamir,” says Redyl. He’s surprisingly spry for an old man, and leaps into the backpack without hesitation.

“So that leaves us with the problem of the Savage,” says Hermione. “We should pool our resources to boost Harlan’s Dispel Magic as much as we can.”

“Agreed,” says Galadriel. She grants him Bardic Inspiration. Harlan gives himself the Guidance of Kord and then casts the spell. Harlan doesn’t mention this, but he suspects it is his knowledge that Kord cares enough to have brought Tannin back that makes the spell so successful. Through the wall of Hanamir’s room, they can hear something like rushing wind.

They go out into the hallway and see that all of the doors have been blown open by the force of the enchantment leaving the Savage. The smell of fresh air after a storm is strong, though none of the windows are open. Tannin deactivates the bear trap and nudges it back into his room. Hanamir knocks on the Savage’s door, now ajar.

“Come in,” says the Savage. The five adventurers file into the room a little apprehensively. The Savage is sitting up in his bed, looking disoriented. “What’s happening?”

“Good morning, Savage,” says Harlan. “How much do you remember of yesterday? Or of the recent past, more generally?”

The Savage rubs his eyes and thinks for a second.

“I remember meeting you all, but that was ages ago, and somewhere else, right? That’s about it,” he confesses.

“You were acting strangely yesterday, and we determined that you were in fact enchanted,” Harlan explains. “We just dispelled the enchantment.”

“Do you know who might have done this to you?” says Galadriel.

The Savage seems to understand, suddenly, where he is.

“We need to leave,” he says. “Now.”

“Before we do, would you mind checking if you’re wearing or carrying anything you don’t recognize?” asks Hanamir.

The Savage checks his pockets, and then rifles through his bag. 

“No,” he says, sounding worried. “But I’m missing something very important.”

“Your arm?” says Tannin. 

The Savage stares at him murderously.

“Not that,” he says.

“Do you remember what took your arm, though?” asks Hanamir.

“That Slaad, of course,” he says, getting it right this time. The adventurers share a look of relief. “And it was also kind of your fault. All of you.”

“Sure, sure, sure,” says Galadriel. “So what else are you missing?”

“Is it, perhaps, a ring?” asks Harlan.

“Yes!” says the Savage.

“Oh, you gave that to me yesterday,” says Tannin, giving him a ring-to-ring fistbump, which the Savage returns unenthusiastically.

“Well, good,” says the Savage. “That was the only thing. Why did I give it to you?” He looks at the mer-dwarf up and down, struggling to understand his own ensorcelled judgment. 

“[Frunk](/characters/frunk/) told us the significance of the rings back in Eillin,” says Hermione, showing off her own. “We probably shouldn’t talk about it here.”

“That is correct,” says the Savage. “We can assume anything we say or do here is being observed by the Lich. You’re a smart one. Who are you?”

“Hermione Daydark,” says Hermione.

“The author?” says the Savage.

“Yes! You’ve read my books?” Hermione is beside herself.

“I don’t read much,” says the Savage. “But my niece is a big fan.”

“So did Frunk send you to the City of the Dead?” asks Harlan.

“No one did. I protect Eillin, and I thought it was important to the town that I come here to try and dissuade the Lich from dealing with the orcs,” says the Savage.

“Well, it seemed to us like things went poorly for Khargol,” says Harlan. “You—and we assume you were under the influence of the Lich—murdered him pretty decisively back there.”

“This only worries me more,” says the Savage. “No one can die within these walls. If Khargol is ‘dead’, it may mean that the Lich accepted his offer and used me to carry out his plan. Khargol is undead now, along with any of his men who perished here.”

Nobody is sure what to say to that. In the silence, the Savage continues.

“They’re closer than ever to overturning the entire orc pantheon.”

“Well,” says Hanamir. “The orc pantheon is not, you know, *great*.”

“It would have unforeseen ripple effects that could destabilize hierarchies we don’t even know about,” says the Savage. “Order is important.”

“On that, we agree,” says Hanamir.

“So should we start making our way to the wall, then?” says Harlan.

The Savage looks at them in confusion.

“Are any of you practiced in the kind of advanced magics that could get us out of here, and do you have the tools to do so?” he asks.

The adventurers stare back at him quizzically, but don’t want to spell out what the rings do, now that they know the Lich is listening in.

“Uh, just trust us,” says Harlan. “You’ll see.”

“Oh, sure,” says the Savage, gathering up his things. “When has that ever gone badly for me?”

They check out of the inn and bid Mandi and Bandi farewell. Harlan retrieves his giant bat steed from the stables and, to his surprise, the bat allows him to climb onto its back again without issue. They fly in a few loop-de-loops before leading the way in the direction of the wall. 

After a few minutes, the adventurers notice that they’re being followed at a distance by a few skeletons. It’s clear the skeletons are trying to be sneaky, but their efforts at stealth are not very effective.

“Stay alert,” says Hanamir. “It’s likely they’ll try to impede our exit in some way.” Then he swivels ninety degrees and starts walking in a completely different direction.

“Hanamir?” says Harlan.

“C’mon, guys,” says Hanamir. “That’s the wrong direction. We need to go this way.”

“But that way leads further into the city,” says Hermione.

“Oh, no it doesn’t,” says Hanamir. “This is the way we want to go.”

Tannin goes up to Hanamir, looking into his eyes and tapping on the side of his own head.

“Think about it, man,” says Tannin. Hanamir finds this unpersuasive.

Hermione casts Protection from Evil and Good on Hanamir, which doesn’t seem to do anything to change the situation.

“Hanamir,” Galadriel starts, “you know we’re in the City of the Dead, and you’re acting like you’re possessed right now, right?”

“Oh, I understand your concern,” says Hanamir, starting to walk backwards. “But really, enough. Let’s go.”

At this, Tannin tackles him, and it’s enough to give Hanamir another chance to throw off the enchantment. 

“Whoa,” he says. He pushes Tannin off of him before he can fly into a barbarian rage out of habit. “Thanks, guys. The Lich possessed me there for a minute. He wanted me to take us to the tombs.”

“Okay, I have had it with this place,” says Hermione. “Let’s get out of here *right now*.”

“Or,” says Tannin, still lying on the ground, “we should go to the tombs, because he’d never expect it.”

“No thanks!” says Hermione, and she marches ahead of them toward the wall. It’s visible in the distance beyond some buildings.

But as the adventurers were dealing with the Hanamir situation, they didn’t notice a group of about fifteen skeletons gathering ahead of them to block their path forward. One of them addresses the group.

“Why leave now?” it says through ever-grinning teeth.
