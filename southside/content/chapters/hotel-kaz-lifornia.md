# Meet Cal

We gather in the lounge at the Prismatic Inn to discuss our strategy for meeting [Kaz](/characters/kaz/) in the morning. We would first like to search the inn for any helpful information about Kaz that we might be able to find. We're not being super subtle about it, and there's a cloaked figure across the lounge who might be eavesdropping on us.

- [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) suggests threatening Toby's salamander for information, or, worst-case, "pet murder"
- Can we pull off an Ocean's Eleven-style heist? Probably not
- Who is sneaky? Who is not? We discuss this at length.

After awhile of this chatter, the cloaked figure approaches the party and introduces himself, tersely, as Cal. 

**Cal:** It looks like you folks might not belong here, and neither do I. I'm looking for someone who may have come through here. A gnome by the name of [Bracket](/characters/bracket/). You ever heard of him?

We tell him about the gnome we do know, [Redyl](/characters/redyl/), and the gnome neighborhood in Aberith called Gillyheart. This doesn't satisfy Cal. Bracket, he says, is an engineer or a mechanic of some sort who builds "metal beasts of destruction." We offer to help him find Bracket if he'll help us investigate the inn tonight, and he agrees.

We decide to go up to the room that Toby arranged for us to plan our investigation.

# Inn-vestigation

First, we check the hotel room itself. We find: 

- nothing
- it's a normal hotel room
- it's pretty fancy though
- there's one entrance and one window, large enough for a humanoid to pass through if needed

Tannin and [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) stay in the room for a long rest while the rest of the party goes to investigate other areas of the inn.

On the first floor, we pass through the restaurant/bar/lounge area and go to the office. [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) picks the lock and we go inside. In the desk, find:

- a list of guests, including long-term guests (Hanamir copies over this list)
- spare room keys
- other hotel administration records—many of which are signed by Toby! (There are some signed by Kaz, too.)

Notably:

- Bracket the gnome is on the list of long-term guests! He was here as recently as last week. He was staying in room 4. (We are staying in room 3.) 

Cal takes the spare key for room 4 and heads upstairs to see if he can find any clues about Bracket. When he reaches the door, he realizes someone new is staying there now, and is a loud snorer. He opens the door with the stolen key and tries entering the room as stealthily as possible, but the door creaks a bit. The person suddenly stops snoring. They don't wake up, but they stir and roll over in their sleep. Cal backs quietly out of the room, hoping he'll have another chance tomorrow. He goes back downstairs and rejoins the others.

[Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) is now climbing the walls and ceilings, feeling around for any secret compartments. Finally, she detects a latch on a landscape painting on the wall. Behind the painting is a wall safe! It's locked with a combination. Hanamir points the Mirror of the Past at the lock, hoping he'll be able to see someone entering the combination. He sees:

- the person using the safe is an elegantly-dressed man wearing an all-white suit with gold trim. 
- He's a human man who looks to be about 40 years old.
- He's storing a significant quantity of coin in the safe, along with several documents.
- Hanamir is able to see two of the digits of the safe's combination 

From that, Hanamir is able to unlock the safe in a few minutes. Inside it, we find:

- 95 platinum
- the deed to the inn
- a list of names an addresses. The only name we recognize on this list is Telura, the elderly elf potionmaker. Hanamir copies these down.
- a stack of unfinished correspondences. One letter, from an unknown person, informs the recipient that "unfortunately, [Odo](/characters/odo/) has re-upped his manticores."

We then move on to the cellar. It's another heavy wooden door, but Hanamir is able to pick it with his thieves' tools. In the cellar, we see:

- nothing special. It's mostly storage.
- But oh wait! There is a partially decomposed manticore on the floor. Cause of death is unclear, other than the fact that there are pieces of it missing. 
- There are some unremarkable weapons down here as well.

We return to our room, as it's now 6 a.m. and getting close to our meeting time.

# Meet Kaz

Around 7:00 a.m., a distinguished-looking man dressed in an all-white suit appears in the hallway outside the party's room. Hanamir lurks somewhere nearby, unnoticed, and Tannin stands guard at the door.

- Hanamir recognizes this man as the same person he saw in the Mirror of the Past interacting with the safe.
- It's a safe bet this is Kaz.

Kaz addresses Tannin. "Excuse me, are you with Mr. Blunderbuss and Ms. von Hastings?"

Tannin grunts affirmatively. 

**Kaz:** All right. I have an appointment to keep. Would you mind stepping aside?

Tannin looks him up and down, kind of menacingly. He notes that Kaz carries a standard-sized, distinguished-looking sabre, maybe just for ceremonial purposes. Its hilt is bejeweled. He wears no armor, and he looks like a normal human being. He might also have a small dagger concealed in his suit jacket, which may be his actual practical weapon of choice. After a long moment, Tannin opens the door and leads Kaz inside. 

## Kaz-versation

Harlan starts off by admitting that the story he told Toby about the stolen chest was not true. He felt he couldn't trust that Toby, a known gossip, would keep a secret. Kaz seems to accept this, and asks our true purpose. Harlan prompts Cal to ask his question about Bracket.

- Kaz looks down his nose at Cal, who is a little rougher around the edges than the type of person Kaz usually deals with.
- Cal explains that he's been retained by some lord to acquire a particular device that only one person knows how to build, and that person is a gnome named Bracket. He says his employer is willing to pay handsomely for information on Bracket's whereabouts. (This might be a lie, or at least overstated.)
- Kaz seems interested in this, especially once Cal says his employer is willing to shell out 300 platinum. But then he turns back to Harlan: "surely you didn't arrange this meeting with me just to make a connection with Bracket?"

Harlan and Galadriel then begin to try and get information from him about the Sky Arrow, and whether or not he knows who sold it. Kaz responds by probing both of their minds for surface thoughts, and gets:
- Harlan, more than anything, wants to understand what's going on; he's convinced that his lack of knowledge was what got him killed in the Shadowfell. His mind is spinning with thoughts of the Sky Arrow, the clowns.
- Galadriel is thinking about the Gehenna army that she saw when she was kidnapped. Her surface thoughts are focused on preventing their attack on the material plane.
- Kaz doesn't show any indication that he learned something valuable from reading their minds, but he knows they're both aware it happened. Their feathers are ruffled and they feel a bit violated.

**Kaz:** Forgive me, but it seemed as if there were some things standing in the way of an honest dialogue. Now we can talk much more comfortably. So... you've encountered the clowns as well. It seems like you're no friend of theirs, and neither am I. So I'd be glad to have a short-term arrangement with you all. 

(Galadriel rolls insight to see if he's being forthright—he's not obviously lying, and he seems pleased about something he saw when he read our minds.)

**Harlan:** We're always open to an opportunity. What do you propose?

**Kaz:** Well, some friends and I have just started in recent days to discuss doing something about the clowns. And it seems as if fate has led you all to stumble into my lap. This group of friends and I would be willing to put you into our employ to root out the motivations of these "clown" individuals.

**Harlan:** Do you believe them responsible for the Sky Arrow, as it has come to be known? 

**Kaz:** I'm not familiar with that term.

**Galadriel:** It's a term we've heard applied to the catastrophe that struck the city. 

**Kaz:** Ah, yes. Yes, we believe the clowns were responsible for that. They're also responsible for a great many other worse things in our opinion—a series of thefts.

(There is an awkward moment where we're not sure if he's joking about thefts being worse than mass-murder. It seems he's not joking.)

**Harlan:** We are willing to hear out your plan. What type of assistance would your friends be able to provide?

**Kaz:** We've managed to obtain a number of clown robes. And we believe we have the location of one of their upcoming meetings. I think the most likely thing that we might ask would be for you all to don these robes and attend this meeting. 

**Harlan:** I think I think we could perhaps arrange that. But I would ask a very small, teensy, really miniscule favor of you in exchange. You're aware, of course, that someone has been brought up on charges for this catastrophe. 

**Kaz:** Yes, Mr. [Goldpeak](/characters/goldpeak/). 

**Harlan:** Yes. Do you think you could help extricate him from the position he's found himself in? You know as well as I that he's not responsible.

**Kaz:** That's all you'd ask? 

**Harlan:** It would be a show of good faith. 

(Tannin elbows Harlan and whispers in his ear: "We're gonna need some platinum upfront soon. We've got to pay someone back.")

**Harlan:** And of course, first, we'd need to understand the scope of information that you have on this organization, and we'd like to understand the company we keep. We'd need to know more about these friends of yours.

**Kaz:** Yes, of course. We can explain to you how we obtained the robes, and you'd know edactly who you'd be going in as. And we want you to succeed, so we'd certainly give you the information that we have on these individuals. And as for my friends... 

(Harlan detects a bit of sarcasm in his voice.)

**Kaz:** ...I'm sure that, as nobles, you both understand the importance of people of our social standing keeping their hands clean. My friends will opt to communicate through me.

(Zoinks! He probably knows we're in disguise.) At this point, Harlan and Kaz take turns reading each other's thoughts. They're both aware that the other one is doing it, and it's a weird vibe.

- Kaz's thoughts are that he's quite amused at his fortune here at having this group fall into his lap. He's quite pleased. And he's not thinking much of anything about his friends; he's just thinking about how this situation will serve him well. So he's not lying, exactly, but he's kind of thinking "everything's coming up Kaz."

**Harlan:** So, with the resources you clearly have access to, why haven't you taken this infiltration step yourself?

**Kaz:** Well, it's really only been in the last few days that some of the pieces have fallen into place that really led us to think this was necessary. And you know... (he pauses.) I think the community would be better served by having these individuals brought to justice.

- Harlan can sense that he was about to say something else (maybe about *himself* being better served), but decided to appeal to us in a slightly different way.

Now Kaz gives Harlan a look, acknowledging the probe into his mind.

**Kaz:** I am glad to share what I know. There's no need. If we're working together, we don't need to hold anything back from one another on this topic. Why not trust me? 

Meanwhile, in the background, Cal uses Primeval Awareness (a ranger skill) to sense if there are any aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead in the vicinity. He senses:

- a fiend, somewhere (but cannot say where, or how close. Is it Kaz?)
- an elemental (we assume this is Toby's salamander)


Kaz leaves to go fetch the clown robes and all of the information he has about the clowns. He will be back in a few hours' time.


## Mi Kaz-a es su casa

Hanamir, with a roll of 35 for stealth, follows Kaz from the Prismatic Inn to his home, which is elsewhere in Silver Hill. Since it's now a new day, and the Mirror of the Past resets at dawn, he is able to point the Mirror at him and see some visions from Kaz's past:

- It turns out Kaz *does* have another form: still humanoid, but a cat person. He's a cat man who walks on his hind legs and wears clothes and stuff. 
- We have heard rumors of Catfolk, but we're not totally sure what they are or where they're from.
- Is a cat person a fiend??

That's really all he gets, but it's a juicy detail. Kaz goes inside his house, and Hanamir leaves—it'd be too risky to follow him in. Now, at least, he knows where Kaz lives.

# A new glyph

Once Kaz is gone, Harlan looks at the scroll given to him by [Nim](/characters/nim/) and [Nizana](/characters/nizana/). We realize (Cal knows?) the meaning of another glyph: "toys."

The words we currently know:

- gods
- children
- toys

The meaning of the overall Message remains unclear, but we're getting there.
