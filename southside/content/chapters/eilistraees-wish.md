# A predator looms

We are in the Shadowfell, and there is a winged thing flying around above us. 

[**Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/):** Well, this could be good or bad. Remember Borgrear’s one creepy-looking Shadowfell dog? He was nice. And maybe it’s a dragon! Maybe I can bond with it over knowing [Buddy](/characters/buddy/). Like, 'You a dragon? I know a dragon.'

Can we see anything? 

- Not really.
- [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) caught a glimpse of a wing, but nothing more. 
- Whatever it is, it's quite large. 
- We can hear it as it flies around.

The darkness here is *unusual*. [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) has a particularly difficult time, though he can see things within a few feet of himself. Zotz’s echolocation is helpful, and he can maneuver okay. We try to get closer to the city; it’s pretty well-fortified and we’re maybe 10 minutes away walking. Hanamir casts Pass Without Trace on the party, and we head back to the city. The sound follows us. It is keeping its distance, but trailing us. It stops short of following us into the city.

**Galadriel:** So this creature is intelligent, since it understands the artificial boundary.

[**Tannin](/characters/tannin/):** Or it’s just an animal that doesn’t want to be around people.

**Hanamir:** So what’s our plan? Stay in the Shadowfell?

**Tannin:** Do we wait for the clowns to come try and steal the coin?

**Harlan:** We know that the clowns have the ability to get here. Is it safer with us than here? Did we get a definitive answer on the protocols surrounding the coin?

[**Chunk](/characters/chunk/):** Let’s talk to Thelatha again and see about another coin flip.

---

# Negotiating for a second flip

Thelatha is helping with the transition to the Shadowfell. She and the king are both unwilling to flip the coin right away—it’s too risky. 

**Harlan:** But how much of a risk is staying in the Shadowfell? There are dangerous things out there.

**Thelatha:** There are dangerous things everywhere. The Feywild has the titans. The material plane has these clowns you speak of, apparently.

**Galadriel:** But what about the, uh, atmosphere here? And how the city declines when it's here?

**Thelatha:** These are all sides of nature. Who says growth is best? 

**Tannin:** But there’s a giant winged monster outside!

**Thelatha:** What? 

- We explain about the creature Hanamir glimpsed, and how it stalked us to the edge of the city.
- Thelatha seems surprised by this, but maintains that if it stays outside the city, it's not a threat.

**Thelatha:** Anyway, we might flip right back to the Feywild, and injure more people, and have accomplished nothing but destruction.

**Chunk:** I gotta imagine the food here must be rough. What do you eat?

**Thelatha:** There are mushrooms.

**Galadriel:** Are they any good?

**Thelatha:** Some consider them a delicacy.

**Harlan:** All right, so given the rules, how long until we can flip the coin again?

- At this point in the recording, everyone cheers because David has squashed an irritating mosquito that had been flying around the room.

**Thelatha:** We don't flip the coin on a whim.

**Harlan:** How do you decide, then?

**Thelatha:** When we determine that the situation has become dire.

**Harlan:** And what was it that caused you to leave the Shadowfell last time you were here?

**Thelatha:** There were two shapeshifting creatures that infiltrated and attempted to gain possession of the coin. 

**Harlan:** How did you know?

**Thelatha:** They were exposed when trying to break into the vault, and we suspected they hadn’t been acting alone. 

**Harlan:** And this is no longer a concern?

**Thelatha:** It’s been a long time.

**Galadriel:** We do know that the clowns have shapeshifting abilities. 

- see: Yurgoz the fox man

**Thelatha:** Well, if that was the clowns all those years ago, this plot must have been going on a long time.

**Galadriel:** Is there a record of exactly what happened? Did their disguise spell glitch? Or did they almost get it and someone snatched their hand away?

Thelatha doesn't know the details offhand, but offers us access to the city archives and says we're welcome to spend an afternoon researching the particulars of the last Shadowfell coin flip.

# Archives & Borgrear

Hanamir takes some time in the archives looking at references to use of the coin and any other powers it possesses, like what he saw in the Mirror of the Past. There are some super old references to these powers:

- For a time, it was wielded by the guardians as a kind of weapon, and not just used as a means to transport the city. 
- There’s a religion around the coin a bit, which has faded over time, focused on beliefs about the importrance of the relationship between three planes. Each plane has a role to play, and back when that was the religion of the city in a direct way, they felt like they’d been blessed by the divine wisdom of three planes. 
- At that time, they harnessed some other powers of the coin. It’s written about poetically, so it's difficult to determine which powers are real and which are exaggerated. 
- You can not only travel between planes, but exist in multiple planes at the same time, and pick and choose which parts of it you exist in. 

We discuss what to do about the coin: do we steal it? Convince them, somehow, to let us take it with us? Do we leave it behind and trust that they have it secure enough that the clowns can't get to it? Harlan wonders if we could put a decoy coin somewhere while we protect the real thing.

**Tannin:** And do that above board? Or secretly?

**Harlan:** I think we have to be honest about it, if we do it.

**Tannin:** What about… we lay a trap? 

- He holds up his beloved bear trap.
- This suggestion is not dignified with a response.

**Galadriel:** If they can't be convinced to leave the Shadowfell, fine. We just need some assurance that the coin is safe. 

**Chunk:** They can contact me on the sending stone if they need any help.

**Harlan:** Then I say we leave. 

The party discusses this, and the idea of "taking the coin is exactly what the clowns would *want* us to do!" wins out. We decide to check on Borgrear and let him know we're planning to leave the Shadowfell, if he'd like to join us back in the material plane.

Borgrear has set himself up in a little apartment in the city. He’s glad to see us. He seems down, in a way that is characteristic of the Shadowfell. But he maintains that he "got what he asked for" in returning to the city.

**Borgrear:** I will stay here. But if you come across anyone from my clan back on the material plane, please give them this. 

- He hands Tannin a sealed letter labeled "Snowmantle."
- Tannin is tempted to open this and read it, but decides not to.

Surreptitiously, Hanamir uses the Mirror on him. 

- He sees the scene of Borgrear as a young dwarf, setting out from the Snowmantle clan. Things at home didn't seem great. He was a lost young dwarf, trying to find a place for himself in the world. Discovering the city was the first time he felt like he had a home. Quickly afterward, the city shifts, and he’s left without a home, and begins his toil in the field to "keep it sacred."

We say goodbye to Borgrear and try to think of things to do in the Shadowfell before we leave.

- Galadriel buries her sad poetry in the ground.
- Chunk and Harlan decide to go forage some Shadowfell mushrooms.

# Mushroom foraging

Just outside the walls of the city, Chunk and Harlan gather a decent collection of mushrooms. They decide not to linger too long—they can hear (but not see) the flapping wings of the creature stalking them overhead. As they walk back to the city gate, they feel an intense pressure start to build around them.

What Chunk sees is this:

- A dragon, looking to be composed entirely of shadow, lands before them.
- He feels himself suddenly close to death. He sees Harlan collapse beside him, unconscious.
- He rummages for his medicine kit, hands shaking.
- Harlan evaporates into shadow before his eyes.

There is no body to recover. Harlan's belongings—the quiznos, his armor and weapons, his glove of missile snare, his ring of featherfall—lie in a heap on the ground. Chunk, dazed and weak, gathers these things into his arms. He uses his guardian ring to return to the city before the dragon can breathe again. 

The party greets him, and he crumples into heaving sobs. Harlan's possessions clatter to the floor.

**Chunk:** It killed him. He’s vapor. Shadow vapor.

The party takes in this news in silent horror.

**Chunk:** This place isn’t safe for us, or for anyone. We need to go. Thelatha is a fool to stay here.

Hanamir points out that he'll need a long rest before he can use the guardian ring again. It’s our lowest point as a party. What do we do?

# In memoriam

There is a service for Harlan. It is held at the cathedral of Moradin, where the vigil for the dwarves who died escaping from the titans was held just a day ago.

King Kolme says a few words, mostly contextualizing Harlan's death with the deaths of the dwarves he led in the tunnel battle.

Tannin gets up to speak. He has been drinking. He rambles through memories of Harlan. 

**Tannin:** I remember when he reached into that bag, and got his hand bitten off, and I laughed and laughed… and when I reached into that bag and lost my own hand… I understood his pain. We went through the same thing. We’ve been through a lot together. And that’s why I vow… to kill that dragon.

- It’s hard to whip people up in a frenzy here, but he wants to rally some people to take down the dragon. There are some takers.
- Despite the gloomy nature of the Shadwofell, some dwarves are willing to follow him into battle.

Galadriel gets up to speak next. She has a difficult time maintaining her composure.

**Galadriel:** Harlan was a good friend. I’ll miss him a lot. He was always making fun of me, and was on my case a lot. But I really loved him. And we’ll all miss him. So will Zotz. He was really brave. And he was a good adventurer.

She sits down.

Hanamir plays the bagpipes, finally, which he’s been carrying around the entire time. He’s never practiced a day we’ve been together, but he plays them perfectly. It goes very well. 

Chunk vows to look after Zotz. 

Galadriel’s pendant begins to glow—the pendant of [Eilistraee](/characters/eilistraee/)’s Wish. She realizes that now’s the time. If the deal she made with Lolth to get it back would be worth anything, it’s Harlan’s life. She falls to her knees on the dais of the dwarf temple, clutching the pendant and pulling it by its chain from her neck. 

**Galadriel:** Eilistraee… in your benevolence… please bring back my friend, Harlan Stormborne.

There’s a swirling of shadow from the ground, almost the reverse of what Chunk saw—Harlan, in a somewhat ethereal form, appears in the temple. He takes a huge, gasping breath. 

Eilistraee’s voice, echoing through the cathedral, says that Harlan's connection to [Kord](/characters/kord/) is severed, and that it is something he himself must restore, if he wishes. She can only bring back the person. His memory may be spotty, but should get stronger over time. And he won’t remember his death. 

Harlan gives Galadriel a hug. She hugs him right back.
