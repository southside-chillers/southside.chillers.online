Where we left off... a tunnel of caves. A strange young wizard 🧙‍♂️ named [Eleazar](/characters/eleazar/). [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) cast Leomund's Tiny Hut 🍕, smelling of pizza and looking iridescent 💎 as always, to provide temporary shelter 🏠. Eleazar explains he does "not" belong to a cult. He says there is "blood in the hills" here?

He begins a story about how his people started hiding. There was a lot of conflict ⚔️ over the land long ago, and they decided to hide away.

"Are you hiding from giant automata 🤖 that scoured the land?" asks [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) 🧜‍♂️.

He's seen those around, but that's not the biggest threat 👹, says Eleazar 🧙‍♂️.

We explain that we're united in pursuit of ⚖️ justice and 👩‍⚖️ good--which does not preclude bashing 🔨 a few heads 💆‍♂️.

"Have you ever heard tell of a lost culture?" asks Eleazar 🧙‍♂️.

Galadriel 🎸 explains about the culture of the Quiznos 🥪 ruins 🏚️, and asks if that might be the one he means.

Gal 🎸 explains we searched out the lost culture who kept the Quiznos 🥪. Eleazar 🧙‍♂️ says he's heard of it, but has not encountered it.

"We're seeking another item of similar power," explains [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) 📖. "Perhaps you could help us, if our goals intersect. It relates to the school of Illusion ✨. Does that ring any bells 🔔?"

Eleazar clams up 🙊.

"My people know much about Illusion ✨, and its importance to us cannot be overstated. There are many artifacts with illusory ✨ power--I have some myself. So I am not sure which one you mean."

"Listen, listen, we don't need to know your whole backstory right now. We just need to know if our goals can align," says Harlan 📖.

"The place you've been hiding is under a deep and powerful spell," says Eleazar 🧙‍♂️. "There is an artifact tied to that to keep the Illusion ✨ alive. Where it is, what it is, is less clear to me."

"We've been traveling across this mountainous terrain for awhile now, and I get the sense it too is affected by illusion ✨. Is this something you can help us pierce? We don't stand a chance if we can' t navigate," says Harlan 📖.

Eleazar 🧙‍♂️ doesn't see it the way we see it. The illusion ✨ doesn't work on him. Tannin 🧜‍♂️ starts to explain our quest, with Galadriel 🎸 playing lute in the background to set the scene.

"We're not looking for this artifact for ourselves," says Tannin 🧜‍♂️. "Something is coming for these artifacts. Maybe you know of this. Clowns 🤡 ! We can talk about that later. But they're coming, and they've already decimated some of the surface cities 🌆. They're using these artifacts for evil🤘, and they're coming for this one next. If you care for its safety 🔐 --you should act with this knowledge 🎓. Know that we're trying to protect it, even now."

"If it's been safe 🔐 all this time, what makes you think these clowns 🤡 can find it now? Why would it be safer in the open?" asks Eleazar 🧙‍♂️. "Are you... destroying these things 🤯?"

Harlan 📖 explains the clowns 🤡 are not of this plane and have been successful at finding and using the artifacts so far, and that we must find them and use them before the clowns 🤡 have the chance to.

Eleazar 🧙‍♂️ has doubts. The stakes are total annihilation 💣 for him and his culture. But maybe, if the whole world is in danger, we can find a way to keep the illusion ✨ intact and find the artifact.

"I guess I'm on board," says Eleazar 🧙‍♂️--a stirring endorsement.

"I wonder if the illusion ✨ is already pierced. Who warned you?" asked Tannin 🧜‍♂️.

Eleazar 🧙‍♂️ does not know. The message he received was straightforward, just telling him "it's time to go an adventure." We confirm it was a lowercase message, not The Message 💌 as reported by [The Messenger](/characters/the-messenger/).

Eleazar 🧙‍♂️ un-blurs himself, and we can finally see his face 🧙‍♂️🧙‍♂️🧙‍♂️.

"My people have been here a very long time," he says. "Long ago, there were orcs 👺 here, dwarves, and humans ⛹️ too. After a series of conflicts and wars⚔️ between these groups, the mountains ⛰️ became divided. Someone in my family 👪... let's say he wanted to take control of the mountains ⛰️ for himself. And instead of having the goal of uniting the mountains ⛰️ once again, he had a goal of dominating them 👑. The only way we stay safe is to keep him away. He's much more powerful than me. At this point, he's long supposed to have been dead ☠️. And he isn't 🧟! He's under a spell ✨ that keeps him alive 🖤. So this persistent spell ✨ keeping him alive and keeping the city 🏙️ must both must go on, or we have to face some kind of reckoning 👨‍⚖️."

"And he lives here?" says Harlan 📖.

"No, he's gone. In fact, he doesn't know about the city 🏙️. He can't remember it 🧠, because he's under a second important spell ✨... cast by his sister 🧙‍♀️. My ancestors 👵 knew that uniting the mountains⛰️, not through violence and not through conquering, but through discourse 🗣️, was the only way forward ⏩. Otherwise, we have to stay hidden 🙈. So she, being a powerful wizard 🧙‍♀️, cast a spell ✨ to help him forget."

Galadriel 🎸 grants Eleazar 🧙‍♂️ a Bardic Inspiration (+d8) for a future roll, as a sign of goodwill.

"We think we might know your great uncle," says Harlan 📖.

"Yeah, skeleton looking guy 💀? Broken crown? Power hungry?" says Tannin 🧜‍♂️. We're thinking it is maybe the Lich 💀💀💀.

"We are the Kandari family," says Eleazar 🧙‍♂️. "My ancestor's name was Thidror. We don't really talk about him often. Most of our lives in the city 🏙️ have been relatively normal, other than this rule that we don't leave, for risk of being found by one of his band."

He explains that the illusion ✨ is similar to gravity 🍎 in how it's discussed. The artifact is studied like one might study the Big Bang 👩‍🏫.

"Is there any lore on what one might do if something went wrong with the illusion ✨?" asks Harlan 📖.

"Virtually everyone in the city 🏙️ is trained in illusory magic ✨, so it's sort of a fend-for-yourself culture, in a way," says Eleazar 🧙‍♂️. "We don't have much of a hierarchy of leadership."

"Well, let's say you encountered a strange group of people who shouldn't be in your city 🏙️. Who would you report them to 🚔 ?" says Harlan 📖.

"Good question. I'd probably first tell my family 👪, who are more or less in charge in the city 🏙️," says Eleazar 🧙‍♂️. "But being as I'm trying to leave the city 🏙️, this presents kind of an awkward situation."

"Are you fleeing something 🏃‍♂️?" says Harlan 📖.

"By leaving, I put the city 🏙️ in danger. If I'm captured--especially by Thidror or his allies--they can find their way to the city 🏙️. THey'll know I'm from here."

"So this is a tough one. We want to go in, and you want to get out," says Tannin 🧜‍♂️. "What if we pretend to take you hostage?!"

Eleazar 🧙‍♂️ explains he has an item that can summon someone out of the city 🏙️, so that we don't have to go in. It's a way to send a message. He could use it to send a message to someone in his family to let them know he's been "taken," but we'd have to promise they'd stay safe.

The Chillers 🍨 confer. [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) 👊 drops from the ceiling to give a silent thumbs-up, then returns to the ceiling.

Eleazar 🧙‍♂️ prepares to use the item. He's summoning his sister, Ari 👧.

"Ari, this is Ele," he says. "I'm in a bit of trouble and need your help. Can you meet me in the tunnels?"

Pretty quickly, he receives a response.

"What kind of trouble? Of course I'll come. What should I bring?!" Ari's message says.

"There are some people here that need our help," says Eleazar 🧙‍♂️. "Get the book of the war history📕, and the book about the artifact📗 from the library 🏫."

She arrives fairly quickly🏃‍♀️to find the pizza hut🍕. She's carrying a handwritten book📓 written partially in Infernal 😈, and partially transcribed ✍️(to Common?). It's about the artifact. There's a name in it, whispered in the shadows late at night, or to scare children ... Thidror 😨. He spent time in a place where he learned this knowledge 🏫, and compiled it here. The other book she's carrying is the one on the war history, and it contains an account of the wars ⚔️ between humans, orcs, and dwarves in the region.

Ari seems startled 😮 to see everyone, but she trusts 🤝 her older sibling 🧙‍♂️.

"I picked up a little Infernal 😈 back in the day," says Harlan 📖. He pores over the book on the artifact to see what he can understand😰. The book tells of this person's journey to a settlement in the southern woods 🌳. The area as described sounds somewhat familiar as the area where we began our journey. The Infernal transcriptions are firsthand accounts told by Tieflings that occupied the southern portion of the woods. The Tieflings had all kinds of stories about these artifacts. One of the sections describes in great detail the workings of the Quiznos 🥪. And there's more...🌟!

There's an artifact that grants eternal life. There's one that is said to be a three-sided coin. One that brings down arrows from the skies ☄️... There's the elemental transmutation cube. It mentions that at least two of the artifacts are believed to be destroyed (Abjuration and Enchantment). It mentions the Illusion ✨ artifact and describes how it works. But there's not much information after a certain point. There are notes in Common where the author of this text speculates about the nature of the illusion ✨ artifact. "Could this be the thing that has protected our home for so long? If these are true, could the other legends be true? And could it be that the thing that has hung around my father's neck 📿since I was a young boy is this artifact?"

(We note that the current leader, Roland, does wear something around his neck. The city's name is Kendar.)

"If we could find a way to eliminate the threat to the city first, there'd be no need to maintain the illusion ✨," says Eleazar 🧙‍♂️. "If we were to propose taking out Thidror, perhaps we'd have a better shot at taking the artifact 📿 from him."

Eleazar notes that the last people who had contact with Thidror were the dwarves. They are not friends with his people. Thidror had betrayed the dwarves, but we don't know much more than that.

Tannin ponder a sneaky mission...

Eleazar notes that the city indeed has animals, so sneaking as animals is viable.

Tannin opts out of sneaking or diplomacy.

Options available:

1) talk to Rolan
2) talk to the dwarves about Thidror
3) bail

Eleazar suspects that escaping will be tricky, even if diplomacy goes well, because the guards are grim, merciless and xenophobic.

We can get an audience best during the day.

LET'S DO IT the team decides. We shall sneak in and talk to Rolan, to try and broker a deal to neutralize Thidror in exhange for the necklace.
