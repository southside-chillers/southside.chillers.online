The early morning sun streams through the windows of the inn above Fleck’s Tavern. The adventurers have had a long rest, and with it, plenty of time to consider the 75% negative opinion of Kord on the topic of entering the City of the Dead. 

They gather in the room shared by Hermione, Galadriel, and Buddy. Harlan has ordered room service, which Fleck brings up on a heavy tray. 

“Thank you, sir,” says Hermione. “I like your eyes.”

“Aw, shucks, ma’am,” says Fleck, glittering. He bows and leaves the room.

Everyone digs in except for Hanamir, who sips his tea and looks somehow even more contemplative than usual.

“It’s so nice to be back in a town with some elven population!” Hermione sighs. “A freshly toasted elf bagel with elf butter and elf jelly… what a delight, after nothing but orc rations!”

“You poor thing,” says Galadriel, loading some elf cream cheese on her own elf bagel. “The stuff they eat is bad enough, but I can’t imagine what they give to their prisoners.” She takes a bite and continues talking, muffled. “You know, nothing beats the elf bagels from home, but these are nice.”

“These are just regular bagels, guys,” says Harlan. “Hermione, is your memory coming back to you at all?”

“Why, yes!” she says. “I remember being on the road, doing research for my book, and being captured by the orcs. They wanted to use me for something—my magic? They wanted… my ears, I think?”

“What about your fellow prisoner?” says Harlan.

“The gnome, Rompit! Yes, he seemed very paranoid. He never spoke to me about anything in this letter, the one from Syndra. And I never saw him leave the cell. I woke up one day and he was gone,” says Hermione.

“Do you think he went into the City of the Dead?” says Hanamir.

“I really don’t know where he went,” she says.

There is a long silence, punctuated by the sound of Buddy chowing down on some elf muesli. Finally, Hanamir clears his throat.

“Friends, I have something to say,” he begins. “The Crypt City is certainly perilous; more perilous than anything we have yet faced. Given what we know, and the auguries of Kord, we must expect danger—we may emerge victorious, or we may not emerge at all.”

Everyone stares at him with rapt attention. Hanamir normally doesn’t speak in paragraphs.

“We could indeed take a more cautious path—gather our strength in greener pastures, hope that the forces of shadow and death in this place remain contained, until we are ready. But I do not believe that the cautious path, in this case, is the wise path. The Shargaasians gather strength; their evil will not stop with the destruction of my books, and neither Eillin, nor Aberyth, may long withstand whatever darkness they seek within those black walls. Time, I fear, is not an asset we can freely spend.”

Drephis State has produced quite the effective public speaker. They listen on, transfixed.

“Harlan and Galadriel.” He turns to them. “We have faced together many perils. I have no cause to doubt your courage or wisdom, but I know that this quest is not yours. Hermione, you have recently escaped captivity and it would be asking much to expect you to join me. This path is mine, and I will walk it alone if I must—but I ask, nonetheless, for your help.” 

He takes a sip of his tea. No one is sure if he’s finished and is expecting a response, or… nope, he continues.

“Come with me, and let us end this threat before it escapes its cage. You saw the fear that the Lolthians had of the orcs. You know the history of the town—the orcs and the undead have burned it before, and they will burn it again.”

His voice reaches a crescendo, and he makes eye contact with each of them in turn.

“I would choose a different way, if I thought I could. If I could choose my time, it would be a time of peace. I would choose warm halls and peaceful study. But this choice is not given to us.”

He looks down at the floor for a lengthy moment, then back at their faces.

“This is a time of strife, my friends, and a time for heroes. This is a time of dungeons… and dragons.”

Galadriel blinks back the tears in her eyes and claps. Hermione joins her. Harlan is quiet, and waits for the applause to die down before responding.

“Well, I think there’s no arguing with a speech like that,” he says, offering Hanamir a respectful nod. “We must go to the City of the Dead. In the interest of not immediately dying, though, I would suggest that we stop by the marketplace to buy anything Hermione might need, and then maybe have a quick chat with the town elders. We know now that the ring of the Been has some type of supernatural power, and there may be more we don’t know about.”

“Agreed,” says Hanamir.

---

In the market, Hermione buys some basic magical supplies necessary for her spells. She also picks up a longbow and a short sword. While she rummages in her small bag of silver, Hanamir goes ahead and covers the charges for all of these items.

“Whoa, thanks!” she says. “I’ll totally protect the hell out of you in the city.”

“Don’t mention it,” says Hanamir. 

Meanwhile, Harlan approaches Galadriel while she is getting her bellybutton pierced at a mildly sketchy tattoo stall.

“Can we talk?” he says. “I need you to think about what you’re going to do when we get back to the city and the urge to jump ahead into danger comes upon you.”

“Yes,” Galadriel sighs. “I’ve been doing some reflecting on that. I feel… disturbed… by my reaction to the city yesterday.”

“Was it the gauntlet, you think, that was the cause of your reaction?” Harlan asks.

“I thought so immediately afterward, but now, I’m not so sure,” she says. “I think it wasn’t necessarily the gauntlet that was to blame. But if I could take it off, I would, because I don’t want that to be a wildcard in our exploration of a dangerous place. I don’t want to put any of you in harm’s way.”

“As a cleric, I know that Lolth doesn’t have any particular alignment to the undead, or to death. She’s more about darkness—and spiders, obviously,” says Harlan. “It may not be related to your gauntlet at all. We should just be on guard when we next approach the city.”

“You could shackle me, just in case,” says Galadriel. She pays the piercer and admires her new jewelry, which is a cool spider charm. “I don’t want to hurt any of you under the influence of Lolth.”

“Thank you for understanding,” says Harlan. “We will see if that’s necessary when we get close.”

They rejoin Hanamir and Hermione. With her new magic supplies, Hermione performs a ritual to see what she can learn about the shimmering red gem she found in the fire. 

“It’s not magical,” she says, sounding surprised. “But the inscription is indeed ancient. It says *Geril IV* in some language I still can’t identify.”

“Geril IV,” says Harlan. “Hmm. I’m not familiar with any Gerils, much less four of them.”

Hermione puts the gemstone back in her bag, seeming unsatisfied. 

---

The adventurers head over to the residence of Mayor Frunk, a stately-looking place on the corner of Boogie Woogie Avenue and Market Street. Hanamir uses the heavy door knocker just once, and Frunk appears.

“Greetings,” he says. “I’d been meaning to seek you all out now that you’re back in town.” He waves them inside, and they have a seat in his parlor. It was obviously once an elegant room, but looks like it has been neglected of late. “I thought you should know that King Slee is sending more of his guards. We’re putting Eillin on total lockdown in the next few hours.”

“So there hasn’t been any progress?” asks Hanamir.

“No, none. We fear that the suspect may strike again, and if he is targeting members of the Been, we want to be extra cautious. There will be a full garrison of the town by order of the king.”

“Nobody in, nobody out?” says Harlan.

“So… if we wanted to leave, we should do that now?” says Galadriel.

“You have about two hours, but yes,” says Frunk.

“Frunk, what can you tell us about the City of the Dead?” says Harlan.

“There were raids on Eillin long ago from the undead that dwell there,” says Frunk. It’s as if a storm cloud has passed over his face as he remembers this. “We sealed up the city afterward using powerful magic. The only way to enter or exit the city is with one of our blessed rings.”

“I did notice that I could see through the wall while I was wearing it,” says Harlan. “But we also found a tunnel underneath the nearby orc temple that we believe might lead into the city as well.”

“Oh, no, that’s quite impossible,” says Frunk.

“Are you sure? It was in the wall of the orc dungeon,” says Hermione, speaking up for the first time.

“Oh yes—how rude of us—this is Hermione, our new partner in this quest,” says Harlan. “She was captured by the Shargaasians, and has agreed to help us stop them.”

“A pleasure to meet you, Hermione,” says Frunk.

“The pleasure is mine, sir,” says Hermione.

“We believe the orcs were trying to access the city,” says Hanamir. “Either through this tunnel, or by chipping away at the wall with axes.”

“They’ll never get in that way,” says Frunk, and he seems confident about this. 

“What kind of magic is guarding the city?” asks Hermione.

“I’m afraid that’s a question for Bryn, who can no longer answer it,” says Frunk. “Sealing the city was his doing.” He pauses, frowning. “What interests you in the city?”

“I believe the orcs have succeeded in entering it, and that they are in possession of some stolen library books,” says Hanamir.

“Library books?” says Frunk. This is clearly not the answer he’d been expecting. “Look, the orcs could not have passed through the wall by any physical means—not underneath it, not through it, not over it.”

“But there is a way in, then? And it involves the rings?” says Harlan.

“There is a passage through the wall from the Shadowfell, but they’d need a powerful magic user to access it,” says Frunk, sighing. “And, yes, the rings allow you to pass through the wall.”

“That sounds like a lot of ways the orcs could have entered the city,” says Galadriel.

“Very unlikely ways,” says Frunk. “And if you all are even entertaining the idea of going in yourselves, I must advise you in the strongest terms not to do so. You would be putting the entire continent in danger. If what dwells inside the city were to ever get out…”

He trails off and doesn’t feel the need to elaborate.

“Why did Bryn make so many rings, then, if even one of them ending up inside has catastrophic consequences?” says Galadriel.

“That’s just how Bryn set it up,” says Frunk. “I assume he had his reasons. He always did.”

“And what, pray tell, is inside the city that should never get out?” says Harlan. “Beyond the undead, which we know about.”

“I fear any more that I say will just encourage you to attempt this foolish thing,” says Frunk.

“We’re going,” says Galadriel. “Anything you say can only protect us on our journey. Any information you can give us is armor.”

Frunk is quiet for a long moment. 

“Though we have never seen him, we believe what dwells in the city may be a Lich,” he says quietly.

“A what?” says Galadriel.

“A Lich. A wizard who has occupied himself with the secrets of immortality… who has defied the gods of death themselves. We… don’t know if there is a way to defeat a Lich. They have surpassed death.”

“Frunk, say that we’re right, and that the orcs have in fact found a way into the city,” says Hanamir. “Would this not be a threat that needs to be addressed?”

Frunk looks Hanamir in the eye, and for a moment, Hanamir can see that he is very old.

“How sure are you?” says Frunk.

“The orcs were gone. There were no tracks leading out of the encampment. There was an underground tunnel toward the city,” says Hanamir. “I don’t know how else to interpret the data.”

“What would you have me do?” says Frunk.

“We’ll need a ring for each of us,” says Harlan.

“I gave you Bryn’s,” says Frunk. “And I’ll give you mine now.” He takes off his ring and hands it to Hanamir.

“So you believe we’re doing the right thing?” asks Hermione.

“I don’t believe I can stop you from doing it, right or wrong,” says Frunk. “But if one of these rings falls into the Lich’s hands, it’s all over.”

“Would you be able to convince H’Jun and Fleck to give us their rings as well?” says Galadriel.

“I cannot compel them to do so,” says Frunk. “You’ll have to ask them yourselves.”

“Thank you, Frunk,” says Harlan. “We promise we’ll do all we can to protect Eillin.”

“You’ve been lucky before,” says Frunk as he walks them out. “Let’s hope you can be lucky again.”

He doesn’t say goodbye; he only gives them a long and unnerving stare.

---

The adventurers return to the tavern under the inn to talk to Fleck. It’s still morning, so the bar is empty except for its most enthusiastic patron, H’Jun, who is passed out at one end. Fleck sits on a cushioned stool behind the bar with a magazine, running his fingers over the pages.

“Hey, Fleck!” says Galadriel. “Whatcha reading?”

“Oh, hi again, guys,” says Fleck. “Just this old copy of Bartenders Weekly. It’s the only thing I can get in Braille.”

“I’m sure we can find something else for you,” says Galadriel, realizing that she and her companions have made this promise before and not followed through. “There’s gotta be a spell.”

Fleck shrugs.

“So what brings you to the bar so early?” he asks.

“We’re on another quest to protect the city,” says Galadriel.

“Sounds like you guys.” Fleck smiles.

“And we need your help,” adds Harlan. He lowers his voice. “Our newest focus is the City of the Dead. Frunk has been kind enough to tell us what he knows, and to share with us his ring.”

Fleck’s smile falls into a grave line, making his coin eyes look sinister.

“You plan to enter?”

“We plan to defeat the evil that lies within,” says Harlan. “By entering, yes.”

“Hi! You can’t see me, but I’m here, too. I complimented your eyes this morning,” says Hermione. “I’m Hermione. It’s nice to meet you.”

“Aha, I thought I smelled someone else,” says Fleck, bowing a little. “You’re too kind. Nice to meet you, miss Hermione.”

Hermione curtsies, but Fleck cannot see her.

“Listen, I care greatly for all of you. You gave me my beautiful copper eyes, and you may not know this, but they’re great for attracting business. I do wonder why you would ask me to send you to your deaths by helping you access the City of the Dead.”

“You believe we’re not strong enough to defeat the evil that dwells there?” says Harlan.

“I do not!” says Fleck, laughing. “Do you?” 

“We’re not sure,” says Galadriel. “But we believe that a party of orcs has entered the city already. We fear that they are trying to loose the terrors within upon the world. And if no one confronts them, we will surely all be dead soon.”

“These are strange times,” says Fleck. He takes off the golden ring he wears on his left index finger. “I will give you my ring.” 

He reaches out with it, and Galadriel’s hand meets his. She takes the ring and quickly puts it on.

“Thank you, Fleck, thank you,” she says.

“Have you heard anything interesting lately at the bar?” asks Hanamir.

“I have heard of the recent discord among the orcs. Some travelers passing through have seen orcs battling each other—there’s something that has divided them up amongst themselves,” says Fleck.

“Have you seen the Savage?” says Galadriel.

“Not since the day of the Moon Festival,” says Fleck. “And only briefly. He hasn’t been back.”

A pathetic groaning can be heard at the end of the bar. H’Jun lifts his head and stares at them as if they are a five-headed Wyrmling from the Ethereal plane.

“Oh hey, bud!” says Galadriel, adopting the tone of voice she reserves for babies and small animals. “You doin’ okay?”

H’Jun groans again.

“What day is it?” asks Galadriel. 

“Today!” grunts H’Jun.

“How many fingers am I holding up?” Galadriel makes a peace sign. H’Jun has to think about it.

“Nine?” he guesses.

“Incorrect,” says Galadriel, looking worried.

“I heard you were looking for a property manager,” he slurs, somehow.

“Yes!” says Harlan, thrilled. “We can pay you a good wage if you take care of the place and manage the tenant relationships. It’s a truly one-of-a-kind space.”

“Where is it?” says H’Jun.

“You know Shinebright’s place, north of town?” says Hanamir.

“He’s not living there anymore?” asks H’Jun.

There’s a pause.

“Nope,” says Galadriel.

“Did I tell you about the dragon?” says H’Jun.

“Yes, you actually mentioned that at the Moon Festival,” says Hanamir.

“Nobody believes me!” 

“We believe you,” says Hermione. “I’m Hermione, by the way.”

“Oh, we’ve met,” says H’Jun.

“Have we?” Hermione is befuddled. “I don’t think so.”

“Yeah, I’m pretty sure we have.”

“Um, anyway, we were wondering if you might part with your ring,” says Harlan. “We’re trying to get into the City of the Dead, and we know—”

“Oh, sure, you can have the ring,” H’Jun says, slipping it off and rolling it down the bar at them. Hermione catches it. “If I could just get a month’s pay ahead of time… I’m a little behind my bar tab, and I just need a little extra…”

“Yes, we can arrange that,” says Hanamir. “Will you look for a tenant for the property?”

“Sure!” says H’Jun. He seems more lucid now. “So you all are staying with Shinebright, then?”

“Oh, um, no, unfortunately, he won’t be back,” says Harlan.

“Did the dragon kill him?!” says H’Jun.

“We don’t know that it didn’t,” says Hanamir.

“No one believes me! They all just say I was drunk!”

“Were you, though?” asks Galadriel.

“I was eight!”

“But were you drunk, though?” she repeats.

H’Jun sighs.  

“Yes,” he says.

---

Back in the town square, the adventurers start making their plans to leave Eillin before the lockdown begins. Galadriel admires the ring Fleck gave her. It’s large enough that she wears it awkwardly on her thumb, but she finds it cool nonetheless.

“Let’s all put our rings together and do a ‘go team’ thing,” she says. She expects everyone to roll their eyes and refuse, but they don’t! Without mockery, the four of them lift up their hands and touch rings. But before Galadriel can make a speech about togetherness and teamwork, they each feel something like a mild electric shock as the gold bands meet. 

“I can feel the other rings!” says Harlan.

“Me too,” says Hanamir.

“One more here in town… that must be Feld,” says Galadriel.

“One in Aberyth, for the king,” says Hermione.

“And one beyond the wall,” says Hanamir. 

Without discussing it further, they rush back to Frunk’s house.

“Frunk,” says Hanamir, when the mayor opens his door. “What you feared has already come to pass. There is a ring of the Been inside the City of the Dead.”

“You have my blessing to go in,” says Frunk. He looks resigned to the apocalypse. “If you are to have any chance at surviving, you’ll want to go back to Bryn’s observatory. He had a book on Liches that might be helpful. I don’t believe it was among the books he bequeathed to others; it’ll be in his remaining collection—what was to become a public library.”

“Is the person inside the sealed city… is it the Savage?” asks Harlan. “We believe he has two rings, not just one.”

“It may be him. And he may have two. I cannot say.”

“Thank you, again, for all your help,” says Harlan. 

And with that, the adventurers leave the town of Eillin, just as the garrison is preparing to stop all traffic to and from the city. Bryn’s observatory rests upon the nearby hill like a student who has fallen asleep sitting up in class. The adventurers jolt it awake with the sound of their footsteps.

The book on Liches is not difficult to find: even in death, Bryn is impeccably organized. Hermione dusts off its spine and reads aloud.

“Liches circumvent death by separating parts of their souls and storing them in objects called phylacteries,” says Hermione. “Oh, so like, horcruxes.”

“What?” says Harlan.

“Don’t worry about it, I read a lot,” says Hermione. “When a Lich is killed, it lives on through the phylactery. It can then re-form a new body. So it sounds like we’re going to have to not only kill the Lich, but destroy its phylactery, too, in order for it to be really gone.”

“How do we know what the phylactery is?” asks Galadriel.

“Good question; we don’t. It says the phylactery can be anything,” says Hermione.

They all ponder this while Hanamir browses Bryn’s book collection for anything else that might be useful. Hermione puts the book on Liches in her bag.

“Are we ready?” says Galadriel.

“Ready as we’ll ever be, I guess,” says Harlan.

As they prepare to leave, Hermione steps on a squeaky floorboard. It shifts noticeably.

“What’s this?” she cries, pushing it to the side with her foot. “I think there’s another book in here!” 

She kneels down and removes the floorboard. Inside is a heavy hand-bound book covered with a sheen of dust. Each page is filled with Bryn’s neat but cramped handwriting.

“I think it’s a journal,” she marvels. She flips to the last page that contains text.

“The last entry is dated just before the Moon Festival,” says Hanamir, looking over her shoulder. “The night he died.”

“He writes that he noticed the orcs striking the walls of the sealed city,” Hermione reads. “He says he knows they won’t get in, but wonders how long it’ll take before they try another method. He says if the undead hordes threaten Eillin again, he’ll have to do some magic to address it.”

“Mind if I keep this?” asks Hanamir. He hasn’t forgotten his pledge to bring Bryn’s killer to justice.

Hermione hands it to him. They leave the observatory and let it fall back into its slumber.

---

The adventurers decide to check out the tunnel in the underground jail cell before approaching the wall. There’s not much conversation between them as they follow the now-familiar path southward.

The opening to the tunnel is just as they left it: dark, cramped, and forbidding. Hanamir ties a rope around his waist and climbs inside, but after about twenty feet, he’s finding it difficult to move his arms at all.

“Pull me back, please,” comes his voice, sounding faint. Harlan heaves on the rope until Hanamir is able to wiggle himself free. He emerges, covered in peaty-looking soil. 

“It gets very, very narrow,” he reports. “I don’t think any of us will have much luck in there.”

“I think I have an idea,” says Hermione. She flips through one of her books until she comes to the spell she’s looking for: Find Familiar. 

She begins to conjure a small creature out of a puff of magical energy, spinning him into material existence with her hands like cotton candy. It’s the first time they’ve all seen her practice serious magic, and they’re all rather impressed with how elegant her process is. The creature glows with what they would later recognize as Hermione’s magical signature: a soft blue light. It twitches its tiny nose at them and practices digging in the cold earth floor of the jail cell. 

“No no no,” says Hermione. “Sir Digs-a-Lot, we’re going to put you in here.” She lifts him up to the mouth of the tunnel. “Go in there and tell me what you see.”

“What is that?” asks Galadriel. “A groundhog?”

“A prairie dog!” says Hermione. “They’re not usually magical, but I have a soft spot for them anyway. I’ve encountered a few in my studies.”

Her eyes have taken on an eerie cast, the color of milk. 

“He’s about seventy feet in,” she says. “The tunnel slopes downward. And then—wow, there’s an enormous chasm. It’s… I think this leads to the Underdark?”

They switch their focus from the mouth of the tunnel to Hermione’s face, and back again, as if waiting for some visual confirmation that this is true.

“Glowing mushrooms… creatures that look like squid, floating in the air… I can hear something that sounds like bats’ wings. No humanoids so far, but there is a rope at the edge of the chasm. Someone was here and climbed down. I wonder if it was Rompit!” She looks suddenly worried. “There’s a giant snake at the bottom of the chasm—and some huge red scorpion spiders—and I think if I let him go any farther, I’ll lose contact…”

She calls the enchanted prairie dog back. It takes him a few minutes, but soon the little creature appears again at the opening of the tunnel. It hops down and sits at Hermione’s feet.

“Good work, little guy!” she says, picking him up and letting him sit on her shoulder. “I’m going to keep you with me while we approach the sealed city. You might be able to do some scouting for us in there.”

The down side of this plan is that, while Sir Digs-a-Lot is active, Hermione is blind. She can only see through the eyes of the prairie dog that sits on her shoulder. For now, this is fine, but it does feel awkward to make eye contact with the small furry creature during conversation and not with the woman herself.

“You could send him into a pocket dimension temporarily, you know,” says Hanamir. He’s trying to be helpful, but Hermione reacts as if he’s just suggested she should drown a puppy. 

As the adventurers approach the wall, the gravity of what they’re about to attempt starts to feel quite real and quite scary. Only Hanamir seems unperturbed as ever. At first, the rest of the party attribute this to his zeal for rescuing his stolen books, but it’s not long until it takes an uncanny turn. With about fifty meters to go, he breaks into a full sprint toward the wall.

“Hanamir! Wait!” shouts Galadriel, but Hanamir either can’t hear her or doesn’t care to listen.

“You’re not feeling the urge to run in, are you?” Harlan checks with her. 

“No,” she says, frowning. “I think it got Hanamir this time.”

Hanamir has already disappeared through the wall. Harlan, Galadriel, and Hermione start running after him. And thus, without ceremony, the adventurers burst through the wall and enter the City of the Dead. 

Luckily, Hanamir hasn’t gone far. He’s standing at an intersection ahead of them, staring down a skeleton on the other side of the road who holds a lute and wears a silly, old-fashioned hat. The city is pristine and unruined, just as Harlan had described it. All the impressive marble walls of the buildings look freshly powerwashed. There is no one around, though, except for this skeleton and his jaunty hat. 

Galadriel, Hermione, and Harlan catch up to where Hanamir stands, enraptured at the sight of the skeleton. The three of them are a bit embarrassingly winded. Galadriel clutches her knees and lets Buddy down from her backpack to reduce the weight. Buddy snorts and sniffs at the ground, looking agitated.

“Hanamir,” she says. “What’s going on? Why didn’t you wait for us?”

“Just felt like the right time to go in,” he says cheerfully. “What a city, am I right?”

“I mean, yeah,” says Galadriel. She catches her breath, to an extent, and looks around. The tallest building, its domed ceiling gleaming in the distance, seems to be in the center of town. She notices the skeleton across the street is holding a lute. “A dead musician,” she wheezes. “That’ll be me in about five seconds if I don’t get some water.”

Seeming to hear her, the skeleton strums a chord on his lute and beckons them to follow him. He points at a nearby tavern. Its sign says “The Ball & Socket.”

“Ha! Cute,” says Galadriel.

“Careful,” warns Harlan. “Please, please do not try to befriend this actual minion of the undead just because he has a lute, please…”

“I like your style, bud!” Galadriel calls to the skeleton. She takes her lute out of its case and does a little riff on it, which the skeleton mirrors. “Wow, you’re good!”

“Oh my god,” says Harlan. He quickly thinks of a distraction. “Hey, why don’t we see if we can pinpoint the location of the Been ring that’s inside the city, now that we’re here?”

The adventurers press their rings together again, but they don’t get a clear picture of where the other ring might be. It’s close, but they don’t know much more than that.

“You know, I think I like this guy,” says Galadriel, after another round of back-and-forth lute riffing with the skeleton.

“Kord save us,” says Harlan. “Hermione, would you let Sir Digs-a-Lot roam around the area a bit and see what he sees?”

“Good call,” says Hermione. Sir Digs-a-Lot jumps down from her shoulder and scampers away down an immaculate stone alleyway. 

“The city looks like… a model city. Like it’s not really real, even. It’s so clean and perfect. Okay, I’m sending him into the tavern… there are three other skeletons inside. They are sitting down, having drinks, playing cards. They don’t seem to notice Sir Digs-a-Lot. And… they’re being friendly to each other. They don’t seem scary,” she says, a little surprised. “Decor in the tavern is really nice, but way outdated, like, pre-Empire, you know? Okay, I’m bringing him back.”

This time, she assents to Hanamir’s suggestion to stow him in a pocket dimension, if only for the practicality of getting her sight back. She apologizes profusely to the prairie dog, who doesn’t seem to care.

“Guys, I think it’s safe to follow this skeleton. From what I saw… I don’t think they know they’re dead,” she says.

The skeleton beckons again and points to the tavern. Galadriel makes the first move, crossing the street toward the skeleton. He moves ahead to hold the door to the tavern open for her.

“Thank you, sir!” she says. The skeleton bows, and the other adventurers follow her into the interior of the tavern. It is indeed a cozy place, as Hermione described—if very old fashioned. All three skeletons turn their heads at the arrival of newcomers, but nobody gets up. The skeleton with the lute goes behind the bar and gestures for us to have a drink. He writes something down on a piece of parchment and hands it to us; his writing is archaic, but not unintelligible.

“My name is Bandi. We don’t get visitors very often here! We’re so excited to have you,” Hanamir reads. In his head, he estimates that the style of writing might be at least a thousand years old.

“Hello, Bandi,” says Hanamir. “Can you tell us anything about this city? We’re travelers from far away, and aren’t quite sure where we’ve ended up.”

Bandi writes some more on the parchment.

“This is Teron, the capital of the continent of Ivrind,” the paper reads. 

“I apologize for the silly question, but what year is it?” says Galadriel. “We’ve been traveling for quite some time.”

Bandi writes some more. “We’re in the reign of Geril VIII, and of course, it is a time of peace. We haven’t had visitors in a long time.”

“A beautiful city like this, and no visitors?” says Harlan.

“It’s strange, yes! I think it’s just a quiet time, not the tourist season,” writes Bandi.

“What’s the ruling family like?” asks Hanamir.

“King Geril has had his health problems, of course, but he rules the city in peace. He’s away right now. He left my brother in charge—Andi!” writes Bandi.

“Is he in the big dome-shaped building?” asks Harlan.

“No no,” scribbles Bandi furiously. “No, don’t go in there. That’s the royal crypt. Don’t go to the royal crypt.” He underlines that a few times. “My brother is in the other big building in town.”

“Who are your friends, here?” asks Hermione.

“Oh! This is Handi, the handyman, and Mandi, she runs the inn, and Vandi, who’s an excellent cook,” writes Bandi.

“And what do you do, Bandi?” says Galadriel.

“I run the bar, and of course, I’m a musician, like you!” writes Bandi. He cocks his head to the side, and Galadriel imagines that if he had eyelids, he might be winking. “We’d be glad to have you all stay in town. I think the inn isn’t too full. Mandi would be happy to get you a room.”

Bandi waves one of the three other skeletons over. The skeleton, assumed to be Mandi, takes up the quill and parchment and writes them a message.

“Hello! I’m Mandi, the innkeeper. I’d be glad to put you all up for the night. The inn is mostly vacant. It’s one electrum a night to stay here.”

“Question for you, Mandi,” says Hermione. “Have you, perchance, seen a gnome around the city? By the name of Rompit?”

“A gnome in these parts?” writes Mandi. “I’m sorry, I’ve never seen a gnome in my life!”

They are interrupted by a startling noise from outside the tavern. It can only be described as horrific—as if the fabric of spacetime itself is ripping, as if the concept of sound is undergoing a traumatic experience. The skeletons are terrified; Handi and Vandi run to the back room. Mandi starts bolding the window shutters closed. Bandi runs to the door and pushes a table against it to barricade it shut.

“What’s going on?!” says Hermione. But none of the skeletons are writing anything down; they’re too busy prepping for what seems like an imminent attack. 

Hermione peers outside one window before Mandi shuts it. 

“There’s a giant bat,” she says nervously. “An orc is riding it. And behind them… there’s this… rift. And, oh god, twelve more orcs are coming through the rift. They have something in a cage that they’re carrying. I think they found another way in.”
