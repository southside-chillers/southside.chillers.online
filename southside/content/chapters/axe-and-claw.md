[Harlan](/characters/harlan/), [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/), and [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) return to the pond in the burning woods. They are still reeling from their encounter in the spider cave, but after Galadriel performs a short Song of Rest, they feel a bit stronger. 

“Shall we explore this pond?” asks Harlan, peering at it. The water is dark, and he can’t see beneath the surface.

Hanamir needs no encouragement and dives right in. He sees about ten skeletons lying in the pond's murky depths. “Dead tieflings down there, it looks like,” he reports back. 

Just then, they hear a loud noise from the woods beside them. Before anyone can prepare for attack, someone crashes through the trees, wielding a battering ram and smoldering faintly. It’s [Tannin](/characters/tannin/)! 

The group welcomes their dwarven friend back and tells him the tale of their recent adventures. Tannin shows off the new ram he spent all that time earning, and then takes notice of the pig. “Who brought the snack?” he asks. 

“RUDE,” says Galadriel. “He’s not a snack, he’s my precious little [buddy](/characters/buddy/). His name… is Buddy.”

“Agree to disagree,” shrugs Tannin. 

Together, they decide to return to Magic’s hut and look around. Under a loose floorboard, they find a blade inscribed with some Draconic script. Galadriel, using Comprehend Languages, interprets that the blade belonged to a tiefling warrior named Valonius, and that he fought with it in many battles. The blade does not seem to be endowed with any magical properties.

“Ooh, let’s take this with us,” says Harlan. “It’s not like the tiefling’s coming back for it.” But Hanamir feels strongly that they shouldn’t take it. The group argues and eventually decides to just leave it. “Fine,” mumbles Harlan.

They return to the pond and then take the path that forks to the right. Hanamir perceives a group of twigblights ahead, along with other assorted woodland creatures. None have noticed the travelers approaching their quiet habitat yet.

Tannin changes all that by jumping ahead in a Reckless Attack, killing a twigblight in one blow. Harlan smashes another one with his warhammer. Galadriel smites one more with her rapier. Hanamir snuffs out another with his darts. 

With four rapidfire twigblight murders out of the way, the party is caught unawares by two stirges swooping down from above. One latches onto Galadriel’s back and starts draining her blood with its hideous proboscis. The other attempts to do the same to Hanamir, but it misses him and hits the ground. 

At the same moment, a wolf jumps out at Tannin and bites him. Tannin, still in Reckless Attack mode, lays waste to the wolf with his battle axe. A second snarling wolf bites Hanamir. 

Harlan thinks quickly and casts Sacred Flame on the stirge that is stuck on Galadriel, killing it in a blaze of fire. Galadriel wastes no time loosing an arrow at the second wolf, wounding it and breaking its hold on Hanamir. She casts Healing Word on Hanamir.

The second wolf then turns and lunges at Tannin. Its teeth dig in, but Tannin uses his battle axe to split a wolf in half for the second time in minutes. 

Partially healed from his wolf bite, Hanamir hasn’t forgotten the stirge that tried to make a meal out of him. He punches it so hard it makes a dent in the ground. A third stirge flies down to attack him, misses, and retreats 40 feet into the air again.

The two remaining twigblights come at Harlan with their shrubby little claws. He dispatches them straight to hell with a thunderous blast of Wrath of the Storm. Then he rounds on the stirge Hanamir just punched and crushes it with the business end of his maul. 

Galadriel shoots an arrow at the third stirge circling above them, but misses. She casts Healing Word on herself and feels a little less lightheaded from all the blood loss. 

The third stirge swoops down at Tannin and latches on, but Hanamir quickly stabs it to death and removes it from Tannin’s neck. But between the wolf bites and the stirge, Tannin has had a rough go of it. Harlan casts Healing Word on him.

They all take a moment to reflect on the carnage before moving on. But as they do, they hear howling from somewhere close by. It’s not over yet…

A small wolf appears before the party, blocking their path. A much larger wolf—a direwolf, in fact—makes itself known behind them. The direwolf bares its teeth and charges at Harlan, who dodges it. The smaller wolf takes a bite out of Hanamir. 

Tannin flies into a barbarian rage and attacks the direwolf for some significant damage. Harlan swings at it with his maul but misses, and then brings out his orb of poison spray, but that too misses its target. 

Galadriel runs up to Hanamir and stabs the small wolf. She then looks behind her and casts Bardic Inspiration on Tannin. Hanamir frees himself from the wolf’s jaws and kills it. At that moment, the direwolf leaps over Harlan and Tannin to confront Galadriel and Hanamir. It digs its teeth into Hanamir in apparent anguish over the death of the little wolf. 

Galadriel sinks an arrow into the dire wolf’s hide, Tannin Attacks it Recklessly, and Harlan takes a swing at it with his maul. Galadriel hits it with another arrow; Hanamir recovers enough to hit it with some darts. Enraged, the direwolf rounds on Tannin and gores him savagely, knocking him down and rendering him unconscious. 

In shock, the remainder of the group tries several ineffective attacks on the direwolf. Finally, Hanamir brings it down with a carefully-aimed dart to the head. Harlan uses his medicine kit to stabilize Tannin. They push onward into the forest, dragging Tannin beside them. 

They come to a clearing around the roots of a giant tree. Harlan, Hanamir, and Galadriel each do some exploring. They conclude that this might be a safe place to rest.

Galadriel has a hunch that the tower may lie to the east. She takes advantage of her spider skills and scales the tree. To her comrades on the ground, she reports: “There’s a river on fire to the west—nothing beyond that. Just a rocky clearing to the north. There’s another tall tree in the distance, but I don’t know how we’d get there. And I can’t see the tower at all from here!”

She comes down, and the group decides to set up camp. Tannin is still grievously wounded but feels confident about his camping skills. “Guys, I got this. Seriously,” he assures them, swaying on his feet. He proceeds to build a mediocre campsite. “See?” 

The others thank him and tuck him in, and he passes out instantly, clutching his enchanted battering ram. Galadriel strums a lullaby on her lute and curls up with Buddy the pig. Harlan conjures a fluffy cloud for a pillow. Hanamir wears the red glass goggles for some bedtime reading before nodding off. They all take a long, refreshing rest and wake up in the morning feeling stronger than ever.

As the party began to wake from its slumber, Harlan gathers everyone up, and over breakfast reveals that he had not been entirely truthful about his past. He is most definitely a cleric of Kord, but he was not raised a pirate, as he had let slip before. Now that he has gotten to know his companions better, he feels he can tell his true story:

## The Ballad of Harlan Stormborne

Growing up deep in the wilderness, Harlan gained an affinity for nature at a young age. His parents, who had instilled in him a respect for the wrath of the natural world, passed away during a hurricane when he was a teen.

Harlan channeled his fury and sense of loss into clerical training under Kord’s auspices. This god, known to Harlan’s family his whole life, embodied the strength and resilience of nature that he wanted to emulate.

After completing his training, and gaining Kord’s favor, in his early twenties, Harlan was appointed guardian of the Cave of Storms. Hidden in a remote area, the Cave looks simple enough from the outside, but true mysteries lay within. Though it shares no ecosystem with the world above ground, save through a system of underground rivers and lakes, the Cave nevertheless maintains a roiling, furious thunderstorm wholly beneath the surface of the land. As Harlan discovered during his more than ten years of service at the Cave, the storm never abates, and even entering is an invitation for destruction.

Why a thunderous storm exists permanently below ground was beyond Harlan’s comprehension, but he knew he must protect it nonetheless. He spent these years mostly alone, foraging and studying what scholarly tomes he could convince those he met to part with. It was not uncommon for travelers to pass through the area, but Harlan ensured that they never lingered long. He would spin wild stories about the dangers of the forest, the monsters that lurk in the streams or the trees, anything but the truth of the Cave, the secret he was sworn to protect at all costs.

He may have spent his entire life as the Cave’s guardian, were it not for the strange dreams he began to receive. Always very vivid, these dreams place him in the sky, floating among the clouds. He wasn’t himself, but neither was he able to identify what form he had taken. He was simply among the clouds, peering down at images that resonated in his mind. An army marching through a now-barren field. A cult of fanatics setting fire to a forest. A band of goblins turning a stream into a sewer. Harlan assumed these cloud dreams were sent by Kord himself, and began making plans to take arms against those who would so callously defile the natural world.

One dream in particular called to Harlan as no other had. A band of travelers was converging on a far-away Elven city, ready to defend it from an unnamed evil. Harlan knew he must join this group, or put everything he believed in at risk. After consulting with the few members of his order he was able to reach, he located a new initiate able to keep watch on the Cave of Storms, and began his journey as soon as he was able.

In the pre-dawn mist, Galadriel takes the red glass goggles with her and climbs up the tree again to see if she can observe the moon. There are two things occluding the moon, she realizes, but she doesn’t know where they’re coming from. She comes back down, disappointed, and attempts to remove the gauntlet of Lolth, but it’s still stuck firmly to her arm.

The group heads east. They come upon the burned ruins of a tiefling village. They don’t find any valuables right away, but after digging through the rubble, they each find 25 electrum. More interesting still: they find the bones of a single creature, much larger than a tiefling, with fearsome claws. Could it be the remains of a small dragon?

Galadriel senses that the villagers tried to protect themselves with a fire repelling spell, but it has long since stopped working. Hanamir inspects the bones again and notes that the clawed arm appears to have been hacked off.

Harlan is eager to move on and check out the flaming river to the west. They go, and find that the river is not naturally on fire: it is like a magical vein of lava, carving out a slight path to the south. Galadriel again senses something arcane; she understands that the river is the source of the entire forest fire. The river runs north to south, and so the origin of the flames must be to the north. In fact...the incline to the north is a red dragon’s lair. The dragon has constructed a false volcano as its nest!

Hanamir decides to at least check the path leading south, but it only goes back to the spider cave and Magic’s hut. So the group ventures north, past the roots of the giant tree to the rocky clearing. At first, all they see is a gate in the clearing, standing alone like an altar.

But when they notice the little spiders emerging from underneath the rocks ahead, it is already too late. A massive spider, larger than any they’ve encountered thus far, appears behind them. It rubs its pincers together, and the smaller spiders shriek with excitement. It is time to feed…
