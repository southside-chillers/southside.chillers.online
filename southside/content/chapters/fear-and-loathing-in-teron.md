“So… how’d your meeting go?” asks Tannin. He blocks Khargol’s blood-spattered path through the anteroom.

“I said let’s go!” shouts Khargol, and his voice sounds tense and panicky. 

“Sorry, not so fast,” says Hermione. She conjures a web that binds him to his position in the center of the anteroom.

“No!” says Khargol. “You have to cut me out of here. We need to go now if we want to survive!”

“Survive what?” says Tannin. “You gotta give us more than that.”

“There’s a paladin who was waiting in there to kill me,” says Khargol. “It was a setup.”

“What about the king?” asks Galadriel.

“I didn’t even get to meet the king. Please, let me out.”

“So who was that skeleton who greeted us, then?” Harlan shouts down at them from his bat. 

“Not the king!” says Khargol, struggling against the web. “I don’t know what it was. Seriously? Come on!”

“How many arms would you say this paladin had?” Hanamir asks without looking up as he begins picking the lock on his shackles. 

“He only had one arm,” says Khargol. “How did you know?”

“Ha!” says Tannin, pleased that he knows who Hanamir is referring to. 

Sure enough, the one-armed wonder himself emerges at the doorway of the throne room. But the adventurers notice that he looks older—by what looks like at least thirty years. 

The Savage stares ahead at Khargol, brandishing his longsword (in one hand!!!), and looks dead set on finishing what he started.

“Savage! It’s us! We’ve secured Khargol!” says Harlan. He lands his bat and ties it to a column.

But the Savage doesn’t take his eyes off of Khargol. He sprints forward down the long anteroom.

“For the love of whatever you find holy, let me out!” pleads Khargol, flailing ineffectually against the web.

The Savage stops directly in front of Khargol and raises his sword, about to deal a mortal blow.

“Savage! Come on! What’s your hurry?” says Galadriel. “We got him. Can we talk for just a second?”

The Savage looks confused for a moment.

“Don’t you recognize us?” asks Tannin. The Savage looks at him, hesitating. He clearly has to think about it.

Hermione can sense an arcane aura around this paladin, whom she’s never met before, but who is definitely behaving oddly. She gives Galadriel a sidelong glance as if to say *You can tell too, right?* Galadriel gives her a look back that says *Yes, totes. WTF.*

“Hey, big guy,” says Hanamir gently. He holds up his ring. “Remember the Been?”

The Savage blinks at him and then turns back to the orc in the web. Then, without flinching, he thrusts his sword directly into Khargol’s chest. It is pretty gross to watch up close. Once he has done this, however, he seems to relax, and looks at each of the adventurers in turn.

“Welcome back,” says Harlan. “You feel better now?”

“How did you all get here?” says the Savage slowly.

Galadriel wiggles her fingers at him, showing off her ring.

“I’m… not sure I understand,” says the Savage. 

“You know what this is, right?” Galadriel asks. 

“Of course,” he says, raising his own hand. “The Ring of Been. But—”

“Hold up, we should ask him a question only he knows,” hisses Tannin.

“Before that, I hoped I could apologize, Savage,” says Hanamir. “We didn’t really get the chance before. I just wanted to say that we’re really sorry that dragon took your arm off back in the Lolth tower. Are we good?”

Tannin looks like he’s about to correct him—it wasn’t the Wyrmling that took the Savage’s arm, it was the Death Slaad!—but then he catches himself. He grins and nods at Hanamir, tapping the side of his head.

“Oh, yeah, of course,” says the Savage, seeming to notice his own arm stump for the first time. “A simple regeneration spell will take care of this. No big deal.”

“Ooh,” says Harlan. “If you happen to have any referrals for regeneration specialists, do let me know.” He waves his own stump.

“I might know a guy,” says the Savage.

“Lucky it snagged just one limb! That sure was an angry dragon, wasn’t it?” Hanamir doubles down. “And I’ll never forget those fearsome scales! The color of…”

He trails off, as if he’s struggling to find the most poetic descriptor. The adventurers stare at the Savage expectantly.

“Oh. Um. Yeah… that’s a fuzzy time for me. I had a lot of things going on,” says the Savage.

“You don’t remember the dragon that ripped your arm off?” blurts Hermione. “I mean, I wasn’t there, but I think I’d remember that.”

“Look, I’m an experienced adventurer,” says the Savage. Now he sounds more like the egotist they remember. “I’ve gone head-to-head with a lot of dragons.”

At this point, Hanamir succeeds in picking the lock on his own shackles. He tries to silently slip them off his wrists and sneak away to the throne room to investigate, but he drops the shackles on the floor. The Savage turns around and glares at him.

“A lot of dragons, huh?” says Galadriel, trying to divert his attention away from Hanamir. “Wow. I didn’t know that!” 

She did know that.

“Yeah, I slew my first at fourteen,” he says. He puffs up a little, then remembers it’s no big deal. “There was a dragon threatening my hometown, and I did what I had to do.”

“Fourteen? That is really impressive,” says Galadriel. Silently, Hanamir tiptoes into the throne room. “So after we fought the last one together, where did you go? I really—” She blushes a little. “I mean, *we* really missed seeing you at the Moon Festival.”

Harlan’s mouth is clenched shut in a frown, as if willing himself not to vomit.

“I take my oath very seriously,” says the Savage. “I can’t just hang around attending festivals when there are threats to the safety of Eillin.”

Behind them, Hanamir creeps around the throne room and sees the skeleton with the robe and staff. It stands next to the throne, unmoving. There is no one else there. The throne, white and polished like everything else, sits on a dais in the center of the room. There is a considerable amount of Khargol’s blood on the floor, as expected. The only curious thing, Hanamir notices, is that the skeleton is now holding a book tucked under his arm. 

Hanamir takes the book from under the skeleton’s arm. The skeleton doesn’t react. He flips through it—it’s completely blank.

“Well, I’m a bard, after all. I guess I wouldn’t understand,” says Galadriel. “But I feel like if you can’t have a little fun sometimes, what’s the point of all the adventuring and fighting? You know?”

“No, I don’t,” the Savage retorts. “If I were to let my guard down just once, my enemies would take the opportunity to destroy everything I’ve—”

The Savage looks stunned. His body has gone still, as if frozen in fear. Galadriel snaps her fingers in front of his face, but he appears utterly lost to the world.

Hanamir thumbs through the book again, checking for enchantments, but it seems to be an ordinary spellcaster’s book with nothing written in it. The skeleton’s staff is similarly mundane. He tucks the book back under the skeleton’s arm and sneaks out of the throne room.

“Hey! Look alive!” Harlan claps his hands (sounding, faintly, like thunder), knocking the Savage back to reality. He looks irritated, but continues his train of thought.

“—they would destroy everything I’ve worked my entire life to protect. It’s too important to risk for the sake of… *merriment*.” 

“Cool, cool,” says Galadriel, dropping her pretenses. “So, just wondering, what happened to your face?”

“My face?” The Savage looks nonplussed.

“Yeah, you look about a million years old,” says Galadriel. 

“Oh, I guess I’ve seen better days,” he says, sounding a bit distant again. “It’s been a long time since I’ve been able to rest. Once the orc threat is defeated, I’ll finally get some sleep.”

“But haven’t you defeated the orc threat? Just now, when you killed Khargol?” prompts Harlan.

At that moment, Khargol sputters and sits up, coughing blood, and makes some kind of gesture, before collapsing again.

Harlan and Hermione look at each other in bewilderment. 

“Should’ve [double tapped](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleTap),” notes Tannin.

Hanamir rejoins them back in the anteroom, having just caught a glimpse of Khargol’s strange outburst from the brink of death.

“Guys, this feels bad,” says Hermione. “I think we should get out of here.”

From outside, they hear footsteps and the sound of metal knocking against metal. A skeleton holding a spear appears in the doorway. He waves at no one in particular.

“Why, because of that skeleton? He’s not a threat,” scoffs the Savage. 

“What about the other one, the one wearing a robe and holding a staff?” asks Harlan. “Were you working with him to trap Khargol?”

“Oh, yeah, I just asked him to send…” the Savage cuts himself off and starts to look nervous.

“Matter of fact, he’s still in the throne room. Awful quiet now,” says Hanamir. “And holding a book.”

“A book?” Hermione perks up a bit.

“Throne room…” says Tannin longingly.

“Yeah, why don’t we go check out the throne room together?” says Galadriel. “And maybe you can explain how you knew to wait for Khargol there.”

Tannin is already through the door. The other adventurers walk to match the Savage’s somewhat hesitant pace. 

“So… you knew about Khargol’s meeting with the king, then?” asks Harlan, after the Savage fails to voluntarily begin explaining.

“The king?” says the Savage. “The king of Teron has been dead for hundreds of years.”

“Interesting. Were you surprised that Khargol believed he’d be meeting him?” asks Harlan.

“The orcs had bad information,” says the Savage.

“Uh,” says Galadriel, “that is some really bad information.” 

They come to stand in the throne room around the pool of blood at the foot of the dais. Tannin is aggressively inspecting the skeleton. He kicks its ankles a little bit as if kicking the wheels of a cart. Hanamir slips the book out from under the skeleton’s arm and passes it to Hermione, who double checks it for magic. She shakes her head.

“It’s completely unremarkable,” she says. “Parchment bound in leather.”

Galadriel prods the Savage again, unsatisfied.

“So the king is dead-dead, and not undead, then? Meaning he cannot be met with?” she asks.

“Hey, I can take you down to the king’s grave, if that would convince you he’s dead,” says the Savage. 

“It would convince me that a king died at some point,” she says. “But not that Khargol would make an appointment with someone he obviously could not talk to.”

“Psh! I don’t think he had an appointment,” the Savage laughs.

“But weren’t you lying in wait?” says Harlan.

“I knew that he was on his way here, so I waited for him,” says the Savage.

“Right, so…” begins Harlan, but he is interrupted by the entirety of the skeleton’s bones falling to the floor in a dusty heap. Tannin holds the skeleton’s staff. 

“I had to see what would happen,” he says, looking defiant.

Meanwhile, Hanamir slinks up onto the dais and circles the throne, brushing a hand along one arm of the chair.

“What are you doing?” snaps the Savage.

“Just admiring this throne here,” says Hanamir. “And wondering what it’d be like to sit down in it!”

“Please do not disrespect the city of Teron that way,” the Savage says sternly. “It is long fallen, and there are many beautiful artifacts. But we don’t touch them. They are sacred.”

“Fair enough,” says Hanamir. “Give me your ring, and I won’t sit on it.”

“The ring again!” says the Savage, his voice rising. “What is it with the rings? Why do you want them?”

“Oh, I just like them,” says Hanamir. “Hell of a ring. Harlan’s got one, Galadriel’s got one, Hermione’s got one. Tannin doesn’t have one. I think we’d like the matching set.”

“Fine,” says the Savage, and he reaches into his bag and produces a second gold ring inscribed with a ‘B.’ He hands it to Tannin. “Now we all have one.”

“Thank you, Savage,” says Harlan, sounding a little surprised. “This is a sign of great trust, and we appreciate that.”

“So can we leave now?” asks the Savage. He is just barely keeping his cool.

“First, let’s put our rings together!” says Galadriel. Sighing, the Savage obliges, and the six of them hold up their rings so that they are touching. But instead of the mild electric feeling they experienced when they did this before, there is nothing. Galadriel is visibly disappointed.

“Huh,” she says. “But hey, if we’re going to be on our way, I might as well let Buddy out for the walk back. I’m sure he’d like to stretch his legs. Or maybe see the view from that throne! How about it, sweetie?”

Buddy’s round pink snout is already poking out of the top of her backpack, sniffing at the air. She lowers the bag to the ground and gently places Buddy on the sleek marble floor. He oinks a bit, but stays close to Galadriel’s legs.

“What is the meaning of this?” says the Savage, his voice deadly quiet.

“Oh, I forget if you met him before,” says Galadriel. “This is Buddy! They’d all say he’s my pet pig, but I’d say he’s more like my best friend.” She beams down at him. “He travels with us on our adventures, usually in my backpack, but I do let him wander around when it seems like we’re not at risk of attack or anything. He’s my special little guy.”

“Please don’t desecrate the throne room with your filthy pig,” says the Savage.

“Oh! Hahaha, he has excellent hygiene, I promise!” Galadriel tries to lighten the moment, but the Savage is livid. 

Then, in an odd instant, Galadriel turns off as if by a switch. She hears a voice.

HEY. IT’S ME.

She looks for signs of comprehension on the faces of her companions and finds none. Only she can hear it. And—without understanding how, or why—she knows in her bones that it’s Buddy.

WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE. THERE’S A LICH IN THE CITY. DON’T LET ANYONE SIT ON THE THRONE. 

The adventurers watch as all the blood seems to drain from Galadriel’s face.

IT WOULD OFFEND THE LICH. 

Galadriel stares down at Buddy, who blinks up at her. She tries thinking back at him. *How do you know this, Buddy?*

NOW’S NOT THE TIME. WE’RE IN DANGER.

*Where should we go?*

ANYWHERE BUT HERE.

Galadriel takes a deep breath and tries to collect herself. She kneels down and guides Buddy into the backpack again and slides her arms into the straps. A bit unsteady, she stands and addresses the Savage.

“You—you’re right. I’m sorry, that was thoughtless of me,” she says. “Bringing my pet out in this place was disrespectful. Please forgive me.”

“All right, let’s go,” says Harlan, looking deeply worried. He makes eye contact with Galadriel, and they silently agree to talk about it later.

“Yes, I think we’re done here,” says Hanamir.

“Let’s go back and see if we can trade what’s left of Khargol for the gnome,” says Hermione.

Again, Khargol sits up, gasping for breath. 

“How is this possible?” murmurs Harlan. He begins to take out his medical tools to try and stabilize the orc leader with the gushing, catastrophic, 110% fatal trunk wound, but the Savage takes out a knife and rests it on Khargol’s throat.

“What are you doing? Don’t save him,” says the Savage.

“It’s more likely that we’ll get the gnome in return if we offer him up still alive,” reasons Harlan.

“Make the trade if you must,” says the Savage. “But I will not let him survive.”

Hanamir carries Khargol on his back while they make their way toward the site of their earlier battle outside of Mandi’s inn. The two guards are still there, looking bored, each holding a chain attached to one of the gnome’s shackles. 

“Prisoner exchange,” announces Tannin. “But for real this time.”

The guards notice Khargol on Hanamir’s back (and the new rider on top of one of their giant bats, landing it like a pro).

“What happened to the others?” one of them asks.

“They tasted our fury!” says Hermione. She makes sparks fly out of her index fingers and gives them some sassy finger guns.

The orcs break into riotous laughter.

“You want some, then?” says Harlan. At that, Hanamir drops Khargol’s totally wrecked body on the ground in front of them. They quiet down.

“All right, all right,” one of them says. “Just let us leave through the portal and you can have the gnome.”

“Deal,” says Hanamir. “Send him to us now, please.”

The two orcs let go of the chains and shove the gnome forward, then disappear into the mind-warping abyss behind them. There is a flash of blinding light, and before anyone knows what happened, the gnome is nowhere to be seen. 

“Fools!” Khargol splutters through a mouthful of blood. “Now we’ll all die here! That was the only way out!”

Fulfilling that prophecy at least for one of them, the Savage again brings his sword down on Khargol, splitting him nearly in half. There can be no doubt that, this time, he is really and truly deceased.

“Jeez,” Galadriel grumbles, still looking pale from earlier. “Can you chill out for like, even one second?”

“No!” says the Savage, heaving his longsword back out of the corpse and wiping the blood and guts onto the leg of his pants. 

“Listen, it’s been an exhausting day,” understates Harlan, who lost an appendage a few hours ago. “What do you say we find ourselves some rooms at Mandi’s inn?” He considers. “If she’ll have us, after what went down in her tavern.”

“Yes,” says Hermione. “That’ll give our friend the Savage here some time to rest and maybe, uh, get back to himself a little, before we leave the city.”

They notice that Hanamir is walking at a bit of a distance behind them as they approach the tavern. His backpack is looking overstuffed in way that is uncharacteristic of his minimalist lifestyle. They silently decide to let him do his sneaky Hanamir thing, hoping against hope that it has something to do with the disappearing gnome.

To their surprise, the tavern is in pretty good shape when they file in. Handi and Vandi are busy repairing the door, and someone clearly spent a long time ridding the floor and walls of the various fluids that were caked there just this morning. 

“Welcome back!” writes Mandi on a sheet of parchment. “If you’d like to stay here tonight, we’d be glad to have you. There are four rooms available at the inn tonight, with two beds each.”

---

The adventurers plus the Savage trudge up the narrow staircase to the second floor, which consists of a cramped hallway and two doors to each side. Harlan and Tannin take the first room, Galadriel and Hermione take the second, and the Savage takes the third by himself.

“You need all the rest you can get,” explains Harlan. “Tannin and Galadriel are both snorers, so you’ll be glad to have a room to yourself.”

“Sure,” says the Savage. He shuts the door behind him without saying more.

Bringing up the rear, Hanamir and his overlarge backpack take the fourth room.

Once the Savage has been quietly inside his room for a good few minutes, Galadriel and Hermione sneak over to discuss plans with Tannin and Harlan.

“So, we’re keeping watch tonight, right?” says Tannin. “We do not leave this guy unattended.”

“Yes, of course,” says Hermione. “One of us should be watching his door at all times.”

“He does seem more like himself now, though,” says Galadriel. “We should ask him about the dragon again in the morning.”

“Oh, yeah, that’s right, do we trust that you’re allied with us and not with him?” snickers Harlan. He does his best Galadriel impression. *“Ooh, the Savage, I missed you at the Moon Festival! Ooh, the Savage, you’re so good at fighting dragons!”*

“It’s called flattery, you dolt,” she snorts. “He loves to hear how impressive he is. And besides that, have you seen him lately? He looks old enough to be my father.” And then she frowns at a sudden terrible thought. “Oh man. I hope he isn’t.”

Tannin, paying zero attention, has retrieved an enormous bear trap from his backpack. 

“I’m gonna put this outside the Savage’s door,” he announces. “And that way if he comes out… there’s a bear trap.”

“Good idea,” says Harlan. 

“Okay, good night,” says Hermione, and she and Galadriel tiptoe back to their room. The inn is quiet. There is no noise from the tavern downstairs. There is no noise from the city outside. 

Tannin and his bear trap take first watch.
