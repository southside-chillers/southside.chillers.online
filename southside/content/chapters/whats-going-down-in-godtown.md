“No! No! What? No!”

[Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) reappears in the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna with great protestation. 

She’s in a room she doesn’t recognize. Before her, there is a table, and on the other side of it sits Yurgoz the fox man. He holds the Pendant of [Eilistraee](/characters/eilistraee/)’s Wish between two furry fingers and inspects it, bringing it up close to his face.

“What’s this for?” he asks. 

Galadriel takes a moment to watch him twirl the pendant back and forth. It’s different here, she notices. Back home, it always used to glow with this faint white light—like the moon. But in Yurgoz’s hands, it looks like a non-enchanted but beautiful piece of jewelry. Warranted or not, this gives Galadriel hope.

“Give me your best guess,” she says.

“You wore it around your neck,” says Yurgoz. “Must be important.”

“Yes, it’s important to me,” says Galadriel. 

“Would you be willing to part with it? I’m willing to negotiate.”

“I’m willing too,” says Galadriel, with a coolness that surprises herself. “I think we can probably help each other. What about this pendant makes it attractive to you?”

“My primary interest is in gathering information,” says Yurgoz. “Sometimes I see things that I find very curious, and I want them. Perhaps if I had the knowledge of what this pendant is, I could assist you.”

“Interesting,” says Galadriel. “Here’s the situation. I’m somewhere I don’t belong. I would like to return home, without any strings attached, in the correct time, with all my limbs, in perfect health, no side effects—” She pauses for a moment. “Though, actually, if you could straighten my teeth a little? That’d be a side effect I could handle. Dental work is hard to come by where I’m from. Anyway…” 

“I get it,” says Yurgoz.

“And I’ll be upfront with you; this pendant is a valuable thing to me,” says Galadriel. “But I don’t think it’s the most valuable thing I have to offer, depending on what kind of information you find most interesting.”

“You didn’t strike me as someone with secrets of value,” he says frankly. “And so I was willing to abide by the loose contract your friends drew up with me to get you back.”

“And what was that?” 

“They wanted you back, and I intended to fulfill that promise right away,” says Yurgoz, holding up his hands in a theatrical show of innocence. “But then I noticed this thing and was intrigued. It seems to possess a power beyond your limited self. They had traded me some trinkets, and I thought that was enough… but this? This is unique. This I haven’t seen before. And if you have something *more* interesting…” He scratches his chin. “You have my attention.”

“I wonder if the power you sense in this pendant might not be small potatoes compared to the type of power you might be able to gain if you strike a bargain with a goddess,” says Galadriel.

Yurgoz stares at her, evidently waiting for the punchline. When none arrives, he continues in a disaffected deadpan.

“This is a thing you can offer?” 

“Potentially. But I have some demands.”

“Yes?”

“I want the pendant back. I want to go home with no shenanigans this time. And I want to know how to disrupt the clowns’ plans.”

“Understood,” says Yurgoz. He narrows his eyes. “Is this goddess of yours one of the ones… I mean, I’m aware of some things on your plane. The forces that have neutralized certain gods. Will I be able to cash this check? Or is your goddess already gone?”

“She’s not gone,” says Galadriel. “In fact, you could say she’s been on the side of the ones doing the neutralizing.”

Yurgoz’s eyes widen. He sets the pendant down on the table.

“That is… startling,” he says. “And you can grant me an audience?”

“Perhaps I could call upon her now,” says Galadriel.

“Okay. Let’s do it.”

“And my demands?”

Yurgoz waves a paw and a scroll of parchment wiggles its way out of his pocket. A pen floats beside it and begins writing. 

“I’ll do you one better. If you can provide this audience, I will offer you the names of three of my colleagues, written down.”

“Only three?” Galadriel raises an eyebrow.

“I obtained these at great cost,” says Yurgoz. “My people can be controlled via their names. I can’t help you with the clowns—that’s not knowledge that I possess. These names, though… these are valuable. You tell me what the pendant does, you get me this audience, and your demands are met plus three names.”

“I’ll tell you what it does, but you can’t use it. You have to give it back to me,” says Galadriel.

Yurgoz’s lip curls.

“I suppose it’s a risk I can take. Maybe we’ll make another deal someday.”

“Yeah, maybe. Don’t count on it. Are we good?”

“We’re good. Please inspect the contract and confirm all is specified to your satisfaction.”

The hovering parchment turns itself toward Galadriel. She reads through it carefully, then nods.

“This is the Pendant of Eilistraee’s Wish,” she says, taking it from his outstretched hand and reclasping it around her neck. “It is able to cast Wish. If you’ve done your magical studies, you know how powerful that is.”

Yurgoz’s face falls, slowly, as if regretting his choices.

“Your turn. You got the pendant; now give me the audience and I’ll send you home.”

Galadriel’s pulse begins to race. She hadn’t really thought she’d get this far. She hopes, absently, that Lolth will even give her the time of day. She kneels on the floor, bows her head, and addresses her gauntlet.

“Mother Lolth,” she begins. “I call upon you now in my hour of need. Grant me an audience for this fox man.”

She feels a spidery tendril slip into her mind. She grasps onto it. It seems to be asking her why Lolth should intervene.

“Lolth, your most devoted servant is in need of your aid. In your service I have found myself in a bind.”

*Most devoted is a stretch.*

Lolth’s voice in her head is like the sensation of a spider crawling up your back on eight cold legs like pinpricks. Lolth laughs.

*But perhaps there is something that I want from you, Galadriel.*

“Name it, Mother.”

*There is a power that has slain beings I thought unslayable. I want to understand it. You seem closer to the answer than any of my typical servants.*

“That’s what I do for you, ma’am,” says Galadriel. “That’s the value I bring to the table every day as your servant.”

*That’s enough now.*

Galadriel feels as though her gauntlet has suddenly burst into flame. It subsides quickly, but she can’t help but cry out.

*I want you to bring me either your companion—the powerful one—or I want you to ally yourself with [Cazna](/characters/cazna/) to find that item you were unable to find in the ruins.*

“I submit myself to your will,” says Galadriel. “I am willing to work with Cazna, but she may not be willing to work with me.”

*Cazna will do what I say.*

The echo of Lolth’s laughter bounces off the inside of Galadriel’s skull. Across the table, the fox man’s eyes are filled with black smoke. He makes a gesture, his face slack with shock, and Galadriel feels herself being sucked out of reality once more.

---

It’s raining when she arrives back in Aberith a second time, and she opts to walk through the substantial puddles toward the Half-Full Flagon instead of [Goldpeak](/characters/goldpeak/)’s estate. The gala looked like it was nearing its end, from the glimpse she caught of the scene before being zapped back to Gehenna, so she figures she might as well get into pajamas and wait for the other adventurers in comfort.

“You made it!” says [Tannin](/characters/tannin/), upon crashing through the door not twenty minutes later. 

“I did,” says Galadriel. 

“So Tails was good for his word!” says [Harlan](/characters/harlan/), looking pleasantly surprised. 

“Kind of,” she says. “He plane-shifted me back to Aberith, stole the Pendant of Eilistraee’s Wish, and then brought me back to Gehenna again, and I…” 

She trails off. The pain in her forearm has dimmed but not gone fully away since her conversation with Lolth.

“He stole the Pendant?” says [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/), face instantly drawn in concern.

“That’s the thing,” says Galadriel. “I, um… I madeanotherdealwithLolth to get it back and come home.”

“You did what?!” says Harlan, at the same time that [Chunk](/characters/chunk/) says, “Pardon?”

“Yeah,” says Galadriel. She pulls the Pendant on its chain out from her shirt. To her relief, she sees that it is once again glowing with a soft, silver-white light. “I asked her to grant an audience to the fox guy so he’d give this back, and in exchange, she wants me to either give her [Buddy](/characters/buddy/) or team up with Cazna to bring her the quiznos.”

“Merciful [Kord](/characters/kord/),” mutters Harlan.

“Oh yeah, that reminds me!” says Galadriel. “Can you like, ask Kord what’s going down in godtown? I heard something from the fox man *and* from Lolth about… the unslayable being slain, and certain gods being ‘neutralized’...?”

“Did we miss something recently?” Tannin furrows his brow. “Maybe with the Shargaasians?”

“Perhaps the Lich found his way out of the sealed city,” says Hanamir.

“Y’all are gonna need to fill me in on this Lich situation at some point,” says Chunk. 

“You know Kord doesn’t take well to my interruptions,” says Harlan. “And yes, Chunk, we’ll fill you in. But I want Galadriel to tell me when exactly she’s planning on delivering Buddy to Lolth.”

“You know I’m not going to do that,” says Galadriel.

“So what, then? You’re going to give the quiznos to Lolth?” snaps Harlan. “Honestly, if you’re going to keep aligning yourself with Chaotic Evil, you might need to re-evaluate your choices.”

“I didn’t want to just relinquish this extremely powerful Pendant to someone in league with the clowns!” Galadriel says. “Chaotic Evil, tragic backstories, whatever—I don’t care what their motivation is—we’ve seen them casually murder a tenth of Aberith’s population.” She takes a deep breath. “We have *time*, at least, to figure out what to do with the Lolth situation. Her request was that we work with Cazna, which in itself might take some time to arrange, and that we *find* the quiznos, which we… might not be able to do, with some plausible deniability…” 

“So the plan, then, is to just give Lolth the run-around and hope she doesn’t catch on,” says Harlan. “Cool.”

“To be real with you, Harlan? It’s worked so far,” says Galadriel. 

The other adventurers watch this exchange in uncomfortable silence. Tannin is the first to break the tension.

“So… should we invite Cazna to come adventuring with us?” He tries to suppress a laugh. “Hear me out: she’d be a lot of fun to prank.”

“Y’all’re gonna need to fill me in on Cazna at some point, too,” murmurs Chunk.

“Oh, I think not,” says Hanamir. “To bringing her along, Tannin, not to filling you in, Chunk.” He’s silent for a moment, thinking. “And here’s why. She's presumably loyal to Lolth, an evil, power-hungry and capricious demon lord. Lolth's interests probably don't intersect with ours at all—she'd be pleased with the destruction of Kord, indifferent to the destruction of Aberith and Drephis, and opposed to the development of the party as a powerful independent entity—and she's explicitly seeking our most powerful artifact. Therefore, in order to work successfully with Cazna, we'd have to successfully pretend that we don't have the quiznos for the duration of our time with her. Working together would give Cazna time and opportunity to gather information about our current capabilities, contacts and goals, which would be difficult to prevent and give Lolth knowledge she could use against us—particularly Galadriel. If Harlan can learn about the quiznos' superpowers from Kord, say, at a mountain shrine, it would be hard to hide from Cazna.”

The other adventurers, soothed by his even voice and sound logic, are enraptured. Hanamir takes a breath, then continues. 

“As well, she's clearly monstrous in form, and would fail to pass as a humanoid in most situations. It would be necessary to hide her when dealing with civilians, and the wise, seeing her, might correctly recognize us as being in league with demons, reducing their willingness to work with us. Assuming we try to intercept the clowns’ mission to the mountains, we’d be heading into a dwarven zone—it's unlikely that dwarves look kindly on demon drow. Cazna might be useful on some kind of independent mission—theoretically, we could send her into cave complexes to scout, or something, but the above problems come up; she might get into a fight with the local dwarves, steal artifacts for herself, double back and spy on us, et cetera.”

Is there more? Chunk tries to begin a round of applause, but Hanamir has one last coda.

“I wonder if we could get her sent to Gehenna to spy on the insect army—she'd probably do better there than we would. We could, perhaps, justify this with evidence that the AML wanted the quiznos, the AML is working with the Gehennans, and therefore the Gehennans might secretly have the artifact…”

“Okay,” says Tannin. “So... no Cazna, then. But we’re gonna plan on going up to the mountains for this three-sided coin before the clowns can get to it, right?”

“Maybe we ought to see if there’s anything at the library about the coin before we go,” says Harlan. “Just thinking about what [Hermione](/characters/hermione/) would do.”

“Yes,” says Hanamir. “Galadriel, did you learn anything else about the clown who abducted you? It was [Pouru](/characters/pouru/)’s contact, Number Six, correct?”

“If we assume there’s only one clown per color scheme, yes, it was Six,” she says. “And as a matter of fact, there was one more detail I forgot to mention. When he took me, he said ‘ever since you stole [Kandir](/characters/kandir/)’s bird, we’ve been watching you’ or something like that.”

“Ah!” says Hanamir. “Kandir’s web of intrigue grows ever more tangled.”

“I’m going to bed,” says Galadriel. “If we’re starting a new quest tomorrow, I need to sleep off all this plane-shifting. Feels like my sinuses are stuffed with hot oatmeal.”

The adventurers each retire for a long rest, with the promise of adventure and the threat of the unknown swirling in their heads.
