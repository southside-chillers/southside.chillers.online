# The second wyvern

We still have the second wyvern to contend with. There’s some disagreement on whether we should just run for it or stick around to fight. [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) takes a moment to cast Cure Wounds on [Chunk](/characters/chunk/), who is down to 8 HP. [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/), sprinting away from the wyvern pursuiing him, grabs [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) kicking and screaming (mid-rage) and continues running toward the mouth of the cave.

From the ceiling, [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) tags the wyvern as it passes by her, and in doing so, casts Bestow Curse on it. (It must make a WIS save on the start of its turn, which, if it fails, it’ll have to give up its action.) Chunk then casts Lightning on the wyvern. Hanamir then uses Stunning Strike on the wyvern; it takes significant damage from his shortsword to a nerve center, like, under a plate of its scales or something. Like pressure points.

Tannin is *very* upset about Hanamir picking him up. He's raising serious hell, punching him and berating him, and then as soon as Hanamir sets him down, he just transitions straight into another rage and starts tridenting the wyvern mercilessly. Harlan casts Sacred Flame for 10 radiant damage. Galadriel casts Cloud of Daggers for 13 damage. 

The wyvern is still stunned, and maybe cursed, so it skips its turn. Chunk clubs it. Hanamir makes several more strikes to the wyvern for 20 points of damage. Tannin makes a reckless attack, and kills it! He's like tenderizing meat with his trident. One last stab, and it crumples up. It got to the entrance of the cave and was just destroyed by a 5-person attack. Go team!

# An arrhythmia

**Galadriel:** So, Chunk, tell us about those eggs!

Chunk brings them out from the Bag of Holding. Galadriel rests her cheek against the surface of the eggs. With a 19 perception check, she’s able to hear the heartbeats inside the eggs. One of them has a slight arrhythmia (but it’ll live a normal life). She lets everyone know this.

Harlan checks the scroll to see if any new words showed up after their fight, but no dice. 

Hanamir goes back into the cave to look for treasure. The manticore den is mostly bones; there are some humanoid bones among the detritus. Next to them, there's a bag containing 300 gold! Nice. There are also large pieces of manticore and wyvern we could harvest. Hanamir thinks some of this might sell. Chunk advises that the heads will probably be the most valuable for use in folk remedies. Harlan also cuts off a claw from the wyvern he killed as a keepsake (dark!). 

Tannin holds the eggs tenderly in his arms as the party makes its way back toward Aberith. He takes an affinity to the one with the arrhythmia, and names it "Tannindor the manticore." He wants to come back and free it from Odo someday. 

“We’ll have a lot fun together someday, you and me,” he whispers to it. 

This affection is contagious, apparently. We discuss keeping Tannindor and only delivering two eggs to Odo—how would he know there were originally three? Since Chunk is sitting out these meetings with Odo as our designated valuables-keeper, he makes the call. He takes Tannindor and disappears with it while the rest of the party makes its way back to Odo's HQ.

# An attempted swindle

We're used to the routine at Odo's HQ this time. A cadre of ne'er-do-wells ushers us in, makes us wait, and get in our faces a little bit before we're greeted by Magnella Oreheart, the female dwarf we met last time. She takes us to a private room.

**Oreheart:** I take it you have the eggs?

**Tannin:** As you know, I’m an expert at stealing eggs.

He hands her the two eggs. She inspects them, seeming satisfied.

**Oreheart:** Odo will be pleased. I’ll let him know what good work you’ve done.

The conversation hangs in the air. 

**Galadriel:** We had a matter we’d like to discuss with him in exchange for these eggs. I believe you were present for that discussion.

**Oreheart:** Odo is indisposed at the moment. But don't worry, he’s good for his end of the bargain.

There is another pregnant pause.

**Harlan:** But you see, this is a trade.

Oreheart's grip on the eggs tightens. Harlan tries to use Read Thoughts on her, but Oreheart passes the WIS save.

**Harlan:** We understand Odo is a busy person. We can wait for him. Once he is ready to see us, we'll be right here.

He sits down and leans back in the chair, crossing his arms. Catching the vibe, Galadriel takes out a pack of playing cards and starts dealing a game of elf poker.

**Oreheart:** You all have earned a token of gratitude, of course.

She tosses a small bag of gold onto the table.

**Harlan:** I’m assuming this isn’t the agreed-upon information about Goldpeak?

**Oreheart:** No, this is a tip. From me.

She moves to leave, but Hanamir blocks the door.

**Harlan:** When can we expect the agreed-upon notes?

Galadriel starts playing ominous background music and gives Bardic Inspiration to Hanamir, who is rolling intimidation. Oreheart is appropriately chastened and realizes she made a mistake here.

**Oreheart:** You know what? I’ll take you to Odo now.

**Harlan:** I’m glad you’ve seen reason, my friend. 

Tannin picks up the bag of gold on the way out.

# A gruesome comeuppance

Oreheart leads us down the mirror hallway to Odo's office. She goes inside first, and we hear Odo exclaim something loudly. It sounds like there’s an argument, but we can’t make it out. Then the door opens and we’re welcomed inside.

**Odo:** It seems you have succeded where others have failed. The eggs are in good condition. I can uphold my end of the deal.

He gestures to Oreheart, who fetches a bundle of papers and hands them to Harlan.

**Odo:** These are the handwritten receipts of my transactions with Goldpeak. He was not a frequent customer, but he did buy and sell several pieces of art. 

**Hanamir:** Let's see, team. Is there anything obviously missing? 

- No. This matches our partial records and fills out the details quite a bit. He was an art dealer, nothing more. 

**Galadriel:** Are there any other details of your dealings with him you can tell us about? When the Minister of Justice tells us financial records tie him to the Sky Arrow… what records would she mean?

**Odo:** First of all, the Sky Arrow was neither bought nor sold here. I know every weapons sale in the Kiln. Nothing is moved in the Kiln without my knowledge. Second of all, I can tell you Goldpeak was not interested in things like that. Now, there is someone who sells weapons—who fancies himself a competitor of mine—whose location I can give you. But I would need his head.

**Galadriel:** I see. With your power and connections, why have you not already taken him out yourself?

**Odo:** I’ve hired people to do so. They have failed, as they have with the manticores. Given your success with the manticores, perhaps you might fare differently.

The party takes a moment to process this.

**Odo:** Oh, I forgot to mention. The last person I hired for this task was offered 450 platinum.

**Harlan:** Your competitor must be a fearsome creature.

**Odo:** Just an annoying one.

**Harlan:** Do you believe this person is responsible for the Sky Arrow?

**Odo:** All I can say is that there is a big spender around town that has been buying up nearly all the inventory my boys have on the street. I’d imagine this person goes to other sources at times.

**Harlan:** Sounds like a good lead.

**Hanamir:** Yes. Let’s do it, team.

**Tannin:** How about an advance? We’ve proven our worth.

**Odo:** No one has come back yet from this task. 

**Harlan:** But given Oreheart’s reluctance to fulfill your end of the bargain in our first deal, forgive us for withholding our complete trust.

Odo turns to Oreheart.

**Odo:** Reluctance? What does he mean?

Oreheart winces. Tannin throws the bag of gold on the desk.

**Harlan:** She tried to buy us off with this.

Odo closes his largest eye. One of his other tentacle eyes faces Oreheart and, horrifyingly, she begins to disintegrate from the inside out. It’s gross and awful to watch. Sort of like what Chunk saw when Harlan died, but slower. Finally, Odo opens his largest eye again.

**Odo:** Will you take the job?

We are silent.

**Odo:** As for the advance, keep the bribe she gave you. And I’ll supplement that with 50 platinum up front.

**Harlan:** You are a reasonable trading partner. Thank you.

Tannin collects the bribe and the advance. Odo chuckles to himself.

**Odo:** Now, don’t make me send someone to take this off your corpse.

**Tannin:** So what are we dealing with here?

**Odo:** His name is Kaz.

He pauses, maybe for dramatic effect.

**Odo:** This enemy is known to take many forms. He apparently has a den up in Silver Hill where he does business. He doesn’t come down into the Kiln—thinks himself above that. He lives as a nobleman.

Odo procures a piece of parchment with an address and hands it to Harlan.

**Odo:** He’s a cunning foe. Be careful.

Harlan reaches to shake hands with Odo, but Galadriel swats his hand down, hissing *"we just saw what those tentacles can do!"* at him under her breath. He opts for a bow instead, and we take our leave.

# An adoption

Outside, we reunite with Chunk and show him the payment. The bribe, the advance, and the gold from the manticore cave add up to 850 gold in total. Chunk seems mostly uninterested in this, and is now in full-on dad mode toward Tannindor. He holds the egg in in a baby bjorn strapped around his torso and pledges to raise it as his own. 

**Tannin:** Only if I get to be his cool uncle!

With custody of the unhatched manticore taken care of, we move on to discussing our next move. We decide to take a long rest at the Half Full Flagon and regain our HP and spell slots. Once we're settled in, we point the Mirror of the Past at the Goldpeak documents, confirming that they’re authentic. We see him signing them. Odo kept them because having records of illicit transactions with a rich person might be handy someday. This outcome is clearly not what he expected, but still. The receipts are mostly for tapestries, which we note were in the chest at Goldpeak’s mansion. 

Before sleep, Galadriel scans the air psychically for [Buddy](/characters/buddy/)… but there's no answer. Seems he’s not in the city, or just not responding.

In the morning, Chunk has an epiphany: he remembers that one of the symbols on the Messenger scroll means “children”!!!! It’s like a memory, like maybe he saw the symbol somewhere somehow and had just forgotten about it temporarily. We theorize that this symbol came to him because he is now a parent to Tannindor. 

Hanamir goes to the half-orc monastery and gives Left Eye 100 gold to keep the place running, which will go a long way. There's no news from them right now, though. Things in the city have settled down after it was clear there'd be no more attacks. The public genuinely accepts that Goldpeak is the culprit. There are conspiracy theorists, but broadly this seems like it makes sense to people. Nothing has been heard so far from the sending stone, either.

# A new lead

We head to Kir [Mirama](/characters/mirama/)’s office uptown with the Goldpeak papers. Tannin walks in familiarly and throws down the receipts on her desk.

**Tannin:** We’ve got the receipts, Kir. Goldpeak isn’t your man.

Then he strides over to a bookshelf, removes a specific book, and finds a flask behind it. He takes a swig and puts the book back. It is 9 a.m. 

Kir smiles at him. She enjoys having him around. Eager to see the receipts, she looks through them.

**Harlan:** As you can see, Goldpeak was not interested in weapons. This is all tapestries and art pieces.

**Mirama:** This is useful. It doesn’t exonerate him entirely, but if he’ll own up to these transactions in the Kiln, we could make some progress with my team investigating him. That’ll take some time. But thank you. If he corroborates these documents, without seeing them, I think we hav something to go for.

**Tannin:** Do you need more evidence?

**Mirama:** I mean, if you can get more, that’d uh... be great.

**Galadriel:** Should we go back to his house?

**Mirama:** Did you not sesarch it thoroughly enough the first time?

Galadriel glances at Hanamir and Chunk.

**Mirama:** Maybe wait on that. My men are fighting the Amber Guard to be let in there, so perhaps now that we have more cause to doubt his guilt, they'll make some progress.

**Galadriel:** Who are your men?

**Mirama:** Brisco... and... Chris.

**Galadriel:** Okay.

**Tannin:** Does the name Kaz sound familiar to you? He’s your neighbor.

**Miram:** No, that’s not a name I know. Maybe it’s a nickanme.

**Galadriel:** He’s supposedly a nobleman in Silver Hill.

**Harlan:** Who would know everyone in the neighborhood? Who’s the biggest gossip?

**Mirama:** Well, there’s Old Toby. He's always there drinking at the Prismatic Inn.

**Galadriel:** Oh yeah, that place! We stayed there after the Sky Arrow attack.

**Harlan:** Great breakfast buffet.

**Hanamir:** Yes, "waffle good" and "waffle evil." 

**Galadriel:** Let’s get some background from Old Toby before we go to the address Odo gave us. And maybe some waffles.

**Mirama:** You'll know him when you see him. He has a distinctive body shape—like an hourglass figure, reminiscent of a peanut. There's a rumor he *is* a peanut that a wizard brought to life.

We thank Mirama for the tip and head out.
