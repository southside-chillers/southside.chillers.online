[Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) hoists herself up and lies flat on the floor, her chin pressed against the cool quartzite. For a few breaths, she rests there without moving. The walls are a mosaic of gemstones, and their multicolored haloes reflect on the silver-white stone beneath her. She closes her eyes, waiting for some kind of catch—a hidden assailant, one last guardian of the quiznos to take out anyone who makes it this far… but none appears.

“Do you see it?” comes [Harlan](/characters/harlan/)’s voice from below.

Warily, she lifts her head. The only features of the room other than the jewel-encrusted walls are a simple wooden ladder resting in a corner, leading up to a hatch in the ceiling, and a cracked wheel on a pedestal in the center of the room. A small dagger is embedded in the hub of the wheel. *Seek not the blade upon worlds divyde.* She knows what it is.

“Yeah,” says Galadriel. “Yeah, I think I do.”

She rises to her knees and slides her backpack from her shoulder. She unrolls a length of rope and ties it to the pedestal so the others can climb up.

“Get up here,” she calls down to them, testing the knot, then tossing the length down through the circular hole in the floor. “You’re going to want to see this.”

A flash of blue, just out of the range of her periphery, makes her breath catch. She turns and sees it: a phase spider, all caviar eyes and bulbous abdomen, its velvet blue legs folded like origami in the corner of the room. Her stomach hits the floor. In the next instant, the spider is gone.

[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) is the first to emerge, hauling himself up the rope with athletic ease. 

“You all right, Gals?” he asks, springing to his feet and looking around. “You look spooked.”

“I thought I just saw…” she starts. She shakes her head. “I saw a phase spider, but it disappeared. Keep your eyes open.”

“Hard not to,” says Hanamir. He whistles through his tusk-like fangs. “Whole lot of nice rocks in these walls, huh?”

Harlan clambers up through the opening in the floor next. 

“All right, nobody touch anything yet,” he says. “We’ve been told how dangerous the quiznos is. Let’s try to use some caution.”

[Tannin](/characters/tannin/) pops through next. His eyes go wide at the sight of the dagger stuck in the wheel, and he stumbles as he rushes over to get a closer look.

“Is that the thing?” he says. He reaches for it. “Can we use it?”

“Just a second!” says Harlan. He swats Tannin’s hand away. “We’ll want to do some magic detection first—”

“You could also help me get up there before you start splitting planes!” calls [Hermione](/characters/hermione/). Hanamir pulls the rope through the floor portal and lifts her into the room. “Thank you!”

“All right, I’m going to sense the dagger’s spiritual properties,” says Harlan. “Hermione, would you mind doing the same for its arcana?”

“Actually,” says Hanamir, “we found something a few rooms back that I think would be perfect to use on the dagger, if we’re hoping to verify that it is indeed the quiznos, and perhaps learn some more about its history.”

He motions to Tannin, who passes him the Bag of Holding. Hanamir’s entire arm disappears inside the bag for a moment and reemerges holding a small silver hand mirror.

“The Mirror of the Past,” he says. “Someone looks in here while thinking of the dagger, and they’ll be gifted visions of its past.”

“Any volunteers?” says Harlan. Ignoring Tannin’s enthusiastic hand raising, he continues. “All right, I’ll do it.” He takes the mirror from Hanamir and walks to the central wheel. “Maybe I need to show it the target first.” He moves the mirror through the air around the dagger from all possible angles. “Okay, that’s the item—uh, Mirror, can you show me anything about—”

The tarnished surface of the mirror glows. The adventurers huddle closer around its tiny viewport.

Generations of Olmen kings, dressed in crocodile skin robes and ruby-red feathers, pass the dagger to their sons in a solemn coronation ceremony. Each father presents it to his son on a cloth embroidered with golden thread.

A king confronts a foe on a battlefield. He looks at both armies, then plunges the dagger into his opponent’s chest. The rival king disappears from reality in plain view of his own army; his men retreat in bewilderment and terror. This happens hundreds more times, on hundreds more battlefields.

One king takes the dagger to his blacksmith. A shaman with a painted face chants while the blacksmith dips the blade into an oven of unholy flames. The king looks pleased.

Orcs approach from the sea in barges, hordes upon hordes, enough to wipe out the city. The king raises the dagger into the sky, and the entire bay is cleared. The kingdom is untouchable. 

A terrible blight has killed the fruit trees that sustain the population, causing a famine. A king is seen twisting the dagger, summoning tentacular beasts of unnatural origin, which the people harvest and turn into life-sustaining calamari.

More beasts, winged and demonic, appear in the sky from nowhere. The king twists and turns the knife to no avail. The creatures swoop from the sky and swallow entire homes. They raze villages. The king and his council argue, and the dagger is sealed away in the highest room of the sacred temple.

“Wow,” says Harlan. The mirror’s surface goes dark.

“It looks like it stopped working by the end,” says Hermione. “Did we come all this way for a knife that doesn’t work?”

“We could still use it to cut up our food and stuff,” says Tannin, scratching his chin. “But nah, we don’t know the whole story. I bet it still works. Just gotta give it a try.”

“So we’re taking it?” says Hanamir. “And… bringing it back to Aberith?”

“We’re still about a half a day from when the Amber Guard said they’d pick us up,” says Hermione. “We can make our way down to the beach and be there with plenty of time.”

“No!” says Tannin. “No, if we get on that boat, they’re going to take it from us.” He narrows his eyes. “And we need this thing to defeat the Lich. I haven’t forgotten about that guy. He’s why we went to Aberith in the first place.”

“We can still take the ship back to Aberith,” says Galadriel. “I’ll just lie and say we didn’t find it.”

“You think they won’t search us?” says Harlan. “You’ll just lie, and they’ll be like ‘oh, okay, bummer, thanks for checking’...?”

“The other reason we maybe shouldn’t get on their ship is Magic,” says Hanamir. “We did promise to keep her away from Aberith.”

“We could ask them to make a stop somewhere else before returning to the city,” says Hermione. Her eyes brighten. “And then we can be rid of her forever!”

“So are we extending this lie to King [Slee](/characters/slee/)?” asks Harlan. “I think we should at least do him the courtesy of telling the truth.”

“It’ll be on a need-to-know basis,” says Galadriel. “But honestly, don’t you think the council would tear themselves apart if they knew we had it? Especially Kandir. I’d trust Slee, and probably no one else.”

“What about Mirama?” says Tannin.

“Not her either,” says Galadriel. 

Their eyes turn to the knife embedded in the old wooden wheel. Harlan extends a tentative hand toward its hilt.

“Objections?” he says. He waits. “Now or never.”

No one speaks. With a few wiggles of the blade, he frees it from the cracked wood. He blinks rapidly. 

“Whoa!” 

His eyes dart around the room.

“I think… I think I’m seeing to another plane,” he says. He points to a corner. “There’s a phase spider over there.”

“I knew it!” says Galadriel. “What else?”

“Nothing,” says Harlan. “It mostly just looks like the same room superimposed on itself. Still lots of gems and gold in the walls.”

“This could get inconvenient if it’s a factor in holding the quiznos,” says Hanamir. “Would you like to put it in that custom concealed dagger holster I commissioned from a leatherworker back in Eillin?”

“That sounds like the perfect place for it,” says Harlan, with a nervous laugh. “Just don’t confuse it with a regular dagger.”

“No, no, I’ll give the holster to you,” says Hanamir. “My reflexes are such that I often draw a weapon before my mind has time to think about it. I don’t trust myself with the quiznos.”

“Ah,” says Harlan. 

“What now?” asks Tannin. He glances at the ladder in the corner of the room. “Peace out?”

“As irritating as she is, even I’m not callous enough to leave Magic behind,” says Harlan. “We should go collect her from the octopus closet.”

“First, let’s help ourselves to some treasure, shall we?” says Hanamir. He smiles and twirls his crowbar like a baton.

After prying as many precious gems from the walls as they can reasonably fit in the Bag of Holding, they file back through the portal in the floor to the battle room. The spirit king is gone, as far as anyone can tell. The door at the bottom of the staircase remains locked shut. 

“All right, what’s our plan to get out of here? Force or magic?” says Hermione. She flips through her notebook and scans for helpful spells.

Hanamir leans against the door. 

“Hard to say how strong this door is,” he says. “Feels heavy. We’d have to chip away at it and then calibrate…”

“Hold up, I’ll just ask [Buddy](/characters/buddy/)!” says Galadriel. Telepathically, she asks him. *What do you think? Wanna break down the door from the other side and let us out?*

HAHA, OKAY, SURE, says Buddy. YOU KNOW, IT’S FUNNY. NOW THAT I’M REALLY ABOUT TO TURN BACK INTO A DRAGON IN FRONT OF YOU ALL, I’M KIND OF NERVOUS.

“Stand back, everyone!” Galadriel says. 

They all jump backward a few paces into the room, but not far enough to avoid the hail of rock and dust that blasts into the air. When the coughing and sneezing dies down, the clouds of pulverized stone part around the smiling face of a truly massive Copper Dragon. 

His armored skull takes up the entire space of what was once the doorway. The rest of his body cannot be seen, but surely extends down the hallway and around the corner; the continuing noises of collapsing stone indicate further destruction in his wake. His teeth alone are taller than Tannin. He inhales with a sound like tectonic plates grinding out a magnitude six earthquake. 

“HI EVERYONE,” says Buddy, aloud, for the first time. His voice is what an upright bass would sound like if it were forty feet tall and made of liquid magma. “GOOD TO FINALLY MEET YOU GUYS FOR REAL. SORRY FOR ALL THE DECEPTION.”

“No worries,” says Harlan, wiping a layer of dust from his face. “It was definitely a good prank. Sorry I talked about killing and eating you all those times.”

“HAHAHAHAHA,” says Buddy. “CLASSIC HARLAN.”

“Buddy!” cries Hermione. She has dropped her notebook on the ground, as if surrendered to the futility of capturing his majesty in words and sketches. “You’re beautiful!”

“OH, STOP,” says Buddy. He chuckles, shaking the entire room. 

“Thanks for busting down the door, dude,” says Tannin. 

“Yes, much respect,” says Hanamir.

“NO PROBLEM AT ALL,” says Buddy. “IT FEELS GOOD TO BE MYSELF, IF ONLY FOR A SHORT WHILE.”

“You’re going to turn back into a pig?” asks Hermione.

“YEAH, WELL, I HEARD YOU ALL ARE GOING TO GO PICK UP THE TIEFLING, AND THE LAST TIME SHE SAW ME SHE GOT REALLY UPSET,” says Buddy. “PLUS, IT’S JUST… CRAMPED IN HERE.” He tilts his head slightly and more potentially load-bearing stone blocks topple to the floor. “HAHA, YIKES.”

“Galadriel? You all right over there?” says Harlan, giving her a gentle nudge. 

She nods, beaming.

“Just admiring my sweet boy,” she says.

“AW, COME HERE, YOU.”

She approaches his enormous face and rests her cheek on his snout, just next to a nostril larger than her head. 

“I’m sorry you’ve had to be a pig for so long,” she says. “I promise we’ll be out of here soon.”

“NAH, I’VE LEARNED TO ENJOY BEING A PIG,” says Buddy. “AND BESIDES, IT MAKES THE TIMES WHEN I TURN INTO A DRAGON OUT OF NOWHERE MUCH FUNNIER, AND WAY MORE SURPRISING FOR ALL THE FARM ANIMALS I ATE.”

“That’s a good point, sweetie,” says Galadriel. She strokes his scales lovingly.

“We should probably pay Elris for damages when we go back to pick up Zotz,” mutters Harlan.

“PIG TIME AGAIN, I THINK,” says Buddy. “I’M STARTING TO FEEL A LITTLE CLAUSTROPHOBIC.”

Galadriel gives him a soft kiss on the snout, and in a sort of reverse-Frog-Prince moment, he turns back into a pig—if possible, even rounder, fuzzier, and cuter than before. Another cascade of rubble falls in the absence of its dragon scaffolding, but Galadriel shields him from the debris.

They proceed down the wrecked hallway toward the mirror room and its adjoining octopus closet. 

“How mad do you think she’s gonna be?” whispers Tannin. “I’d bet my remaining hand she’s gonna try to kill you right away, bro.”

“Guess we’re about to find out,” says Harlan. “And stop gambling with your appendages.” He sighs deeply, then strides into the cramped room with the oversized statue feature. Magic is right where they left her, shackled to one of the stone octopus’s tentacles. “Hi, Magic. We’re back.”

“Did you find it?!” she says breathlessly. 

“It was already gone,” says Galadriel. “Someone else had gotten there first. I’m sorry, Magic.”

“What?!” Magic’s face falls. “You’re kidding. No, you—you must’ve—you just didn’t look in the right place! It has to be here!”

Harlan unshackles her from the statue and helps her to her feet. 

“We can go back there now and show you,” he says. “It certainly looks like the right place. We’re as disappointed as you are.”

“I doubt *that*,” she drawls, but she appears eager to inspect the treasure room herself, and follows the adventurers back through the battle room and up into the heavily bedazzled attic of the pyramid.

Galadriel has the uncanny feeling of being watched as she reenters the room. The memory of the phase spider prickles at the back of her neck, very much like the physical sensation of an insect creeping down her spine. *Maybe I’m just being dramatic,* she thinks. *But maybe not.*

“Let’s not linger here,” she says. It really does feel like her gauntlet is tighter on her wrist than usual, the skin underneath itchy and clammy. It reminds her of something she hasn’t felt in a long time. Her blood buzzes.

“What’s wrong?” asks Hanamir. He pries a baseball-sized emerald from the wall and tosses it from hand to hand a few times.

“Kind of a bad feeling,” says Galadriel. She can’t tell if she’s the only one who can hear a faint laughter… a familiar laughter, too… is it just a trick of their voices echoing off the chamber’s walls?

Magic circles around the room touching every gem in turn, waiting for one of them to be a secret compartment containing the quiznos, while Harlan and Hermione hover next to her like the anxious parents of a toddler. Meanwhile, Tannin grips the rickety wooden wheel on a pedestal in the center of the room, pretending to be a ship’s captain.

“What kind of bad feeling?” says Hanamir, alert. “A spidery feeling?”

Before Galadriel can reply, a disembodied giggle makes the hair on Hanamir’s arms stand on end. He recognizes the laughter, cold as a moonless night.

“Hello,” says [Cazna](/characters/cazna/). “It’s good to see you all again.”

The late High Priestess of Lolth stands face-to-face with Galadriel. Her entire lower half has been replaced with a set of eight long, black legs. The adventurers stare at her, frozen in shock.

“Cazna,” says Galadriel, unable to hide the question in her voice. “We killed you.”

Cazna’s full-throated laugh rings in their ears. 

“Yes,” she says. “Yes, I failed Lolth’s test.” She gestures at herself, smiling coolly. “This is what becomes of those who disappoint the Mother. It’s a fate you’ll know about soon enough.”

“Oh, you think so?” snorts Galadriel. The surprise has begun to wear off, and she feels a surge of power from her gauntleted wrist. “I think you’re just jealous that I’m better than you were at serving Her.”

“It’s time for your test now,” says Cazna.

“Oh, good!” says Galadriel. “I love tests. Even pop quizzes, like this. I perform very well under pressure.” She strums a sequence of power chords on her lute. “It’s probably why Lolth blessed me, and why she continues to favor me. And why I defeated you.”

Cazna’s face drains of its pretense of humor. With a wave of her palm, she casts Command.

“Give me the item,” she hisses.

Galadriel begins emptying her pockets onto the floor as if seeking something urgently.

“What item do you want?” she says, in earnest. She holds up the flask of goop from the oni’s well. “This?” She holds up her crossbow. “This?” Her lute.

“Don’t play games with me,” says Cazna. “The quiznos. Give it to me.”

“I don’t have that,” says Galadriel. “I desperately want to obey your Command, though. Can you pick something else?” She holds up a tiny sweater she knit for Buddy. It has ducks on it. “This?” 

Behind Cazna, she sees Harlan climbing up the ladder to the hatch in the ceiling. He pulls Magic after himself by the hand. Hermione and Tannin wait below. Hanamir, she notices, is in a meditative pose similar to the one that initiated the Stunning Strike against the giant snake in their last battle.

“Is this situation funny to you?” asks Cazna, throwing the proffered pig sweater to the floor. 

"Honestly, yes, a little bit,” says Galadriel, pelting Cazna with every item she has on hand, including a wadded-up granola bar wrapper that’s been in her pocket for months.

Hanamir completes his meditation and punches Cazna in the kidneys. She doubles over, and appears injured, but then seems somehow revitalized by the attack. She starts to laugh again, turning to Hanamir.

“No need for that,” she says. “I’m not here to fight. Just here to have a conversation with this one.” She raises a hideous foreleg and points at Galadriel. 

“Please accept one of my items,” Galadriel begs, head bowed.

“Fine,” says Cazna, picking up the granola bar wrapper and tossing it in her mouth, which has noticeably more teeth than it needs to have. “I see that you do not have the quiznos. Very well. You will tell me which one of your friends has it before we’re through here.”

“Sure,” says Galadriel, jumping to her feet. “But before that, we have some catching up to do!” 

“We don’t, actually,” says Cazna. “I’ve been checking in you all from time to time since our last meeting. Watching from another plane. I know what you’ve been up to.”

“Oh, don’t worry,” says Galadriel, “I’m not actually interested in hearing what’s been going on for you after the footage of your death won first place on Aberith’s Funniest Home Videos.” 

Cazna doesn’t laugh, but Tannin, from midway up the ladder to the roof, guffaws. 

“Thanks Tannin. But seriously, Cazna, I only said that because I was going to ask if you wanted to hear another joke, since you liked my last one so much,” says Galadriel. She grins. “And then I was going to do this.” 

She casts Tasha’s Hideous Laughter. But—as she should have perhaps foreseen, after Hanamir’s attack—Cazna deflects the spell like a senior varsity player blocking a freshman’s attempt at a slam dunk.

“Not as funny as last time,” says Cazna.

“Ah, you’re right,” sighs Galadriel. “It wasn’t my best work.”

Behind them, Hermione disappears onto the roof, followed by Hanamir holding Buddy in his arms. Galadriel can’t help but feel a mild panic rising in her throat. 

“So, are we done here?” she asks.

A small object covered in cloth—which Galadriel recognizes, in alarm, as one of Tannin’s loincloths—hurtles down from the hatch and hits Cazna in the back of the head. The object falls to the floor and tumbles out of its wrapping. It’s the gem from the octopus closet, the one that makes you dance uncontrollably if you touch it.

“Good one, bud!” she calls up at him.

“Did she do it?” comes Tannin’s voice.

“No, but it was funny anyway!”  She collects herself and clears her throat. “Sorry,” she says. “Please—are we done? Is it time for my test, or what?”

Cazna purses her lips in an odd smile. 

“I can tell it’s not the right time,” she says. She fixes Galadriel with a flat stare. “So long, for now.”

She disappears. Galadriel feels her gauntlet humming with energy, slightly painful now, like a series of weak electric shocks. She shakes her arm, willing it away.

Tannin’s face appears in the hatch.

“Come on, Moonwater!” he says. “And bring back my loincloth!”

Galadriel grabs the corner of the “garment” gingerly and picks up the dance gem with it, depositing both in a small bag at her hip. Heart pounding, she sprints to the ladder and climbs as fast as she can, before her fellow Servant of Lolth decides to change her mind.

The air outside is clean and surprisingly cool. She gulps it in by the lungful, marveling at how good it feels to no longer breathe dust and thousand-year-old catacomb air. She’s greeted by a shrieking hug from Hermione and an abundance of enthusiastic licks to her cheek from Buddy, who is held out to her by Hanamir. Harlan and Tannin throw up their arms and join the group hug, all of them laughing with incredulous relief.

“We did it,” says Harlan. He pats his chest, where the quiznos lies concealed in its holster, and glances behind himself at Magic, who is busy kicking rocks down the stepped sides of the pyramid. “Praise Kord, we really pulled it off.”

“And would you look at that view?” says Hanamir, shading his eyes. “That’s quite a view, folks.”

From here, they can see the partial collapse of the jungle room beneath them, the remains of the mudslide that swept them into the temple in the first place, the vast canopy of the island’s greenery beyond, and farther still, the glittering ocean.

---

The adventurers trudge seaward.

“Ooh! I can see the Amber Guard ship!” says Hermione. “At least, I think that’s what it is—a little bit fuzzy—but something’s on the horizon.”

As they approach the shoreline, Hermione’s updates regarding the ship become more and more frequent.

“Looks like a brigantine rather than a full-rigged ship,” she says. “Interesting. Wonder if that means they expected to be picking up fewer of us, or none at all.”

“We can ask them when they get here,” says Harlan, “which will probably still be awhile.”

“Of course, of course. I just, you know, as the only full-blooded elf here, I take my responsibility regarding long-distance sight *very* seriously,” she reminds them. “I just want the entire group to stay informed.”

“Thank you,” says Harlan. “So, Magic, have you thought at all about where you’d like the ship to drop you off? You remember that you’re not allowed to go back to Aberith, right?”

“Yes,” says Magic. “I’m not an *idiot*, even though you insist on treating me like one.”

Her opinion of the adventurers has soured dramatically since her painstaking search of the treasure room did not yield the quiznos. She has taken to muttering offensive things under her breath and feigning innocence when someone asks her to repeat herself.

“All right, where to, then?” Harlan asks.

“Nowhere,” she says. “Just leave me here. I’m serious! I know the quiznos is still here—I can *feel* it—and my life has no purpose unless I can find it and—and—*complete my quest*.”

She spits these last words with a venomous look at Buddy, who is digging contentedly in the sand.

“Well?” says Harlan, looking at the others. “I’m open to it. It might not be such a bad idea.”

“Really?” Hermione raises her eyebrows. “Don’t you think she’s going to do something, um, no offense, but something *evil* as soon as we let her out of our sight?”

“Annoyingelfdorksayswhat,” mumbles Magic.

“What?” says Hermione.

“Nothing, jeez! Leave me alone!”

“So was it your assumption that we’d be babysitting her forever, then?” asks Harlan.

“No, but we did talk about getting her some kind of rehabilitation, right?” says Hermione. “Someone experienced with cases like hers who could help her get her power back under control, or at least… someone wise? And responsible?”

“We did discuss it,” says Hanamir. “But was that part of the deal? Are we doing right by our word to Slee if we simply leave her here, so long as she never returns to Aberith?”

“Oh! Oh! You know who’d be perfect?” says Tannin. “That guy, that smart guy with the observatory!”

“[Bryn](/characters/bryn/)?” says Galadriel.

“Yeah! That guy,” says Tannin. It dawns on him. “Oh, wait, dang.”

“Magic, are you sure you can fend for yourself if you’re alone here?” says Harlan.

“I did it for years, in the burning forest, before you all showed up,” says Magic. 

“That’s a good point,” says Harlan. He thinks for a moment. “All right, Magic. We’ll leave you here if that’s what you want. But we’ll check in on you every once in awhile to see how you’re doing.”

“Do it or don’t, see if I care,” says Magic. 

“And you understand that if you attempt to return to Aberith, you will undoubtedly be executed?”

“Yes! I am never going back there!” She pauses, then for good measure: “I hate it there!”

“Good,” says Harlan, rolling his eyes.

“Exile, I think, is the most humane punishment she could have gotten, anyway,” says Hanamir. “And exile to a place one finds fascinating is barely punishment at all.”

---

When the Amber Guard ship lands on the beach, the guardsmen look frankly stunned to see them.

“I had my money on *all* of you being dead,” one of them says, scowling. “Thanks a lot.”

They hike up the gangplank to the ship (“Only a brigantine, as I said!” chirps Hermione) while some other dejected-looking soldiers pass fistfuls of coins to one elated young man who went out on a limb and thought only two of them would die.

“How about that Mirama wine, am I right, guys?” says Tannin, summoning it from the Bag of Holding as soon as he’s fully on board. He uses his trident to uncork it and pours them each a glass, passing one to each of them as they step onto the deck. “Cheers.” 

“None for me, thanks,” says Hanamir. “Vows are vows.”

“Are you sure?” says Hermione, tasting it. “This is a very good wine.”

“I *knew* it,” says Tannin, his glass empty and his teeth purple. “I knew it was good.”

“To victory!” says Galadriel, her glass outstretched. Her arm still stings beneath the gauntlet, but the wine dulls the sensation.

From the ship’s hull, they wave down at Magic while sipping their wine, which is indeed quite excellent. Magic makes a sarcastic wave back and then stomps off into the jungle. 

“Remember,” calls Harlan, as she disappears from view, “this isn’t goodbye forever!”
