As the Dragonborn try to grab Cal and pull him into the rundown building, he drops one of his wondrous figurines and yells “MUFASA!” This is the command word that brings the figurine to life. It transforms into a real live golden lion, growling and snarling. Cal steps back and draws his rapiers.

Cal: “I’ve been more than patient with you. You’re not taking me anywhere else. Back off.”

The more aggressive male Dragonborn (whose name, we learn, is [Patrin](/characters/patrin/)) is brandishing his own weapon: an elongated hexagonal prism bent into an L-shape, like an oversized allen wrench.

From a distance, the rest of Team Chillers hears the lion’s roar and Cal’s stern voice, and they know it’s time to throw down. [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) charges ahead toward them as Patrin begins swinging his weapon at the lion—the element of surprise seems to have thrown him off his game, though, and he misses at first before hitting with his next attack. The lion bites back with a critical hit on Patrin, and Cal hits him too, doing a whole mess of damage.

[Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) sprints after Tannin and casts Bardic Inspiration on Cal at a distance. [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) chases after her in turn and casts Command on [Krodgeg](/characters/krodgeg/), but the Dragonborn passes his WIS saving throw. [Chunk](/characters/chunk/) brings up the rear. Seeing that the group has decided to join the fray, he shouts, “Not a good idea, guys!” at them as they approach. He then takes a swing at the lion with his short sword. 

[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/), meanwhile, sees the bloodlust in Tannin’s eyes and concludes he probably has the fight handled. He decides instead to Shadowstep from outside the building to a dimly-lit area inside the building. It’s quite run-down on the inside, mostly destroyed. There’s not much to see on the first floor—just crumbling walls and detritus. There is a staircase leading down to a root cellar of some sort. There are no other Dragonborn around. He slides into a crouch by the staircase and prepares an action to attack anyone who emerges.

Back outside, Cal tries diplomacy again.

Cal: “This is not what I wanted. I was being patient, but I’m not being patient any longer. Stand down and we’ll stand down.”

But neither of the Dragonborn has a response to this. It seems the time for negotiation has passed. Cal and his lion then take turns attacking Patrin, who drops to the ground, unconscious.

Krodgeg lets out a cry, and Tannin arrives with a reckless attack. Tannin’s still salty about Krodgeg blasting everyone with ice breath, and he gets a solid stab into his side with his trident. But the sound of Krodgeg’s distress must have alerted more of the Dragonborn inside the building—a previously unseen Dragonborn is hurtling up the staircase. Hanamir, lying in wait, swiftly stuns this individual, who tumbles to the ground, useless.

Galadriel casts Suggestion on Krodgeg. “Let us in peacefully!” she says. She’s banking on the notion that there’s still some goodwill between them, in spite of the trident wound he’s just sustained.

Krodgeg fails his saving throw, and the suggestion takes. “Uh,” he says, mostly just confused, “be my guest.” He gestures toward the door behind him, and then, seizing the opportunity, bolts from the scene, clutching his trident wound.

The party goes inside and sees Hanamir and the stunned Dragonborn at the top of the stairs. Harlan takes out the Dimensional Shackles and affixes them to this person’s ankles. The crew is being as quiet as possible, and can hear the sound of at least one more Dragonborn from downstairs. 

Hanamir puts a finger to his lips and begins creeping down the stairs, silent as a cloud. He takes the Mirror of the Past out, and, since he’s unable to use it for its magical properties until tomorrow, uses it simply to see around corners. There are in fact two more Dragonborn down in this cellar: one is [Akra](/characters/akra/), the female dragonborn who collected Krodgeg from the Black Unicorn, and the other is male, seemingly of the same ranking as Krodgeg within the hierarchy of this organization. Hanamir scatters some caltrops on the floor and then sneaks back up the stairs.

Chunk takes his club and clocks the shackled Dragonborn over the head with it. Cal follows up with three more bludgeoning attacks, and then Tannin joins in on this action with the butt end of his trident, and the Dragonborn is successfully knocked out.

The sound of the caltrops hitting the floor apparently alerts Akra and her colleague. The colleague fails a DEX save and takes some piercing damage when he attempts to come up the stairs in pursuit of Hanamir, but Akra succeeds, and is now barrelling up the stairs.

She hits everyone with an icy blast of cold breath as she reaches the landing. “Which one of you is in charge?” she roars.

Galadriel responds by casting Tasha’s Hideous Laughter on her. In a stroke of luck, this works, and Akra falls to the floor, laughing hysterically. Hanamir takes the opportunity to attack her, doing 25 damage. Chunk then summons a lightning bolt that hits Akra at full force for 28 damage and at half force to her colleague for 14 damage.

Cal directs his lion to pounce down the stairs at the last Dragonborn and make a claw attack. He opts to attack Akra himself, dealing 25 damage. Tannin flies into a rage and hits her for another 25. With her last breath, Akra exhales one more cone of ice breath at the group, doing considerable damage, before falling to the floor, deceased.

“I bet she didn’t think when she woke up this morning that her house burning down would be the least bad thing to happen to her,” says Cal.

At this point, the last Dragonborn raises his hands in surrender. 

“Will you stand down and allow us to shackle you?” Galadriel calls to him down the stairs.

“Can I just… go free?” comes the Dragonborn’s voice. “I don’t have anything to do with this.”

“Well, you’re here,” says Galadriel. “Can you tell us what’s going on?”

“The person who could tell you what was going on is dead now,” says the Dragonborn. He grimly stares down at Akra’s body.

“Tell us everything you know,” says Galadriel.

“Look, okay, I’ll do that, but I don’t want to be shackled. I saw what happened to the other guy.”

But the Dragonborn eventually assents, seeing as he’s quite outnumbered. He tells a story not too different from Krodgeg’s: he was sent to Aberith a few months ago to participate in this operation Akra’s been running. They had a mission. He wasn’t let in on all the details of it, but he explains that they were in the preparation and planning phases of some kind of attack. They were getting military training. Akra was a revered leader, and had been cast out by the tribe, but had a loyal following among some.

She was cast out for being a heretic, apparently. He doesn’t know all the details—it was before his time, he explains. He’s quite a big younger than her. But back in the Crater (or Tubé, in Draconic), he fell in with a crowd that was sympathetic to her.

As for the cult, and the talk of Pholtus the “impostor” god… he only knows that there was some kind of confrontation between Akra’s followers and the followers of Pholtus. Pholtus isn’t part of the pantheon that he grew up with in the Dragonborn community.

“So, what were you all building down here?” asks Galadriel.

“A tunnel,” says the Dragonborn. “Toward the center of the city. I don’t know much more. But you’re welcome to look through Akra’s things, if you want to try to figure it out.”

He gestures toward a room with cots, similar to the one at the house Cal burned down. There’s a small chest that belonged to Akra, and some of her papers scattered nearby. They’re written in Draconic, so Harlan takes a look. She has notes on her various recruits; there are about ten of them. She’s frustrated by the slow progress that’s being made, and the relatively scarce resources she’s been given. The target of the attack is revealed to be Aberith’s Temple of Liberty, which is indeed dedicated to Pholtus. There’s one more piece of correspondence written in Common; it says that the schedule has been moved up and that she will need to make do with the resources she has. It’s not signed. It looks like it may have been received recently.

Cal turns to the last Dragonborn and asks, “Do you know who [Deladriel](/characters/deladriel/) is?”

“No,” says the Dragonborn. “Never heard the name before.”

Tannin is searching the corpses, and takes a ring from Akra’s finger that is warm to the touch. He also notes that there is a symbol tattooed on each of them that looks like one of the symbols from the Messenger’s scroll. It’s the one that looks like an eye.

“What’s the story with your tattoo?” Galadriel asks the Dragonborn.

“This was a brand that Akra wanted to put on all her recruits,” he says. “It was a show of faith. She told us it meant ‘power.’”

“And are you aware of the person known as the Messenger?” asks Galadriel.

“No, that’s not something I’ve heard of,” says the Dragonborn.

Cal begins musing out loud. 

“The person I’ve been hunting is a sadistic and dark figure,” he says. “If Akra was excommunicated for some sort of heresy, maybe she joined up with him.”

“Maybe... he’s the Messenger,” says Hanamir.
