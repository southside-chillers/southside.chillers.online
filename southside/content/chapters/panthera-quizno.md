The adrenaline rush of the ball game has the adventurers in a feisty mood, the trauma of the rolling boulder all but forgotten. They relive the moment in excited whispers as they tiptoe onward.

“The gloves and the bag? And how we used them both?” [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) marvels. “Brilliant. And that was all you, [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/).”

“Ah, it was a team effort,” Hanamir says diplomatically, through an irrepressible smile. He scans the next room. “All right, what do we have here? Cat room? Looks like a cat room.”

He stands with his hands on his hips and takes in the surroundings as his companions file in beside him. The room is oddly-shaped, an irregular hexagon. The southeast wall is carved to resemble the face of a snarling tiger with hollow eyes. Opposite, on the northwest wall, a large circular stone calendar hangs above a slab table. There are two more sets of closed double doors, and the remaining wall space is decorated with the hanging pelts of jaguars, cheetahs, and lions. 

“Definitely a cat room,” Harlan concurs, walking a slow circle around the room. He stops in front of a taxidermied wildcat in the center of the room. It has some stuffing poking out of its head. “Looks like somebody tore a chunk out of this guy’s ear.” 

“Maybe he got in a fight with six-nippled shirtless dude over here,” says [Tannin](/characters/tannin/), staring up at a statue of a man holding a spear and wearing a panther’s head as a mask. The statue has a jagged scar running the length of his chest—which does, troublingly, have six nipples. He frowns, unable to avert his gaze. “You know, as a habitually shirtless person myself, I get it. I do. But if it were me, I’d keep that situation under wraps.”

More stuffed cats are scattered around the room, frozen in sitting, pouncing, stalking, and begging poses. 

“Before we do anything that might cause these creatures to wake up, let’s do a thorough trap check,” says [Hermione](/characters/hermione/).

[Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) climbs up the side of one fur-decked wall and runs the perimeter along the ceiling. 

“The tiger face wall might be something,” she says. “I can’t tell how to trigger it, though.” She creeps around to the stone calendar in the opposite wall. “There’s something behind here! Like a gate closure sort of thing? Maybe if we stuck the pole between here and the wall…”

Hanamir lifts up the eight-foot pole and passes it to her. 

“Okay, careful,” says Hermione. “Let’s back up somewhere in case arrows shoot out of all the walls or something.” She ushers [Magick](/characters/magick/) and [Buddy](/characters/buddy/) back behind the cover of the hallway they entered through. 

Galadriel slides the pole behind the stone calendar and nudges a latch. The circular stone swings open like the door of a safe, revealing a narrow passageway behind it. Another table sits directly inside. On the table’s surface rests a small jade statue—of a cat, naturally—along with a knife. She squints into the darkness. It’s cramped, but they could fit inside if they wanted to. There’s another set of doors at the end of the passageway.

“More glyphs on the walls in here!” she reports. “Tannin, come look.”

Tannin drags his feet on his way over.

“‘Caution... turn back... no tresspassing,’” he translates. “There are some symbols of abjuration, too. The vibe is definitely ‘keep out.’”

“This must be a table for sacrifices,” says Harlan. “That knife looks ceremonial.”

“Do we take the jade cat?” says Hanamir, eyebrows raised. “Probably worth another thirty gold.”

“Guess that’s what we do,” says Galadriel. She climbs down to the floor of the passageway and picks up the jade cat. “Now, my money’s on the cat man coming to life riiiiiiight—”

A roar rings out in the main room. Hanamir’s short sword is already lodged in the cat man’s upper back. Harlan follows up with a savage swing of his hammer, knocking the part-feline individual to the floor.

“We are getting better at this,” Galadriel notes approvingly. 

As he hits the ground, the cat man morphs into a full-on panther. The fur on its front is patchy, corresponding with the scar that had been on his chest. 

Tannin takes a running leap at the panther and lands trident-first on its back. Harlan gets another hit with his hammer. 

“Oh man, this actually really sucks now,” says Galadriel, loosing an arrow at the cat with a grimace. “I didn’t come here to murder endangered animals!”

The arrow hits close to the panther’s scar. It roars again and digs its teeth into Tannin’s side. 

“It’s about to murder an endangered Tannin!” Tannin retorts. He rights himself and gets a good headlock grip around the panther’s neck and pulls backward. It snaps. He drops the panther’s body to the floor and stares at it a moment, waiting to see if it’ll transform back into a human hybrid. It does not.

“You know,” says Harlan, “in his cat form, he looks a lot like the stuffed cat in the middle of the room.” 

He inspects the stuffed cat more closely, especially the missing ear. Experimentally, he picks the entire thing up.

“Oh! There’s definitely something inside here,” he says. He pulls some stuffing out of the rip and digs a hand in. “Ew, it’s slimy. Wriggly. Probably should have used your Mage Hand, Galadriel...”

When his hand comes out, they all gasp. He’s holding a bloody, throbbing human heart. Everyone is silent for a moment, listening to its rapid pulse.

“Okay, I’ll say it,” says Tannin. “Should we eat this?”

“What? No!” says Harlan. He holds the heart out as far away from himself as he can. “Why would we eat it?”

“To absorb its powers,” says Tannin. “Obviously.”

“No, no, no,” says Harlan. 

“It could be a sacrifice,” says Hanamir. “Does [Kord](/characters/kord/) accept sacrifices as payment for divinations? Or general life advice?”

“Kord has no need for that kind of morbid exchange,” Harlan shudders.

“Lolth might like it!” says Galadriel. Harlan gives her a look. “Just kidding, of course,” she says with a nervous laugh.

“Well, I do think we should stab it, even if we don’t do so in honor of a god,” says Hanamir. “My hunch is that it’s the actual life force behind our panther foe.”

“Pass it to me,” says Galadriel. “I’ll use the ceremonial knife over here. It’s cool.” 

Harlan walks over to where she sits on the middle of the wall next to the open calendar stone and hands her the heart, shuddering.

Galadriel places the heart on the stone table inside the passageway. It twitches rhythmically. She holds the knife over it, hesitating.

*Hey, um, Lolth? If you’re listening… I wanted to say thanks for all the gauntlet stuff.* 

She brings the blade down, piercing the heart. Blood erupts over her hands and onto the table and floor, pooling at her feet.

WHOA. YOU SURE ABOUT THAT ONE, GALADRIEL? Buddy’s voice says in her head.

*Not really*, Galadriel admits. She can already feel Lolth’s approval. A warm, powerful energy is spreading from her gauntleted wrist in tendrils that crawl up her arm and into her own heart. It feels… good? But kind of bad… but mostly good! She shoots Buddy a “guess we’ll see what happens” look.

“Aha, I knew it,” says Hanamir. The slain panther crumbles to dust at Tannin’s feet. “This must have been the reason behind his scar.”

Meanwhile, Hermione is struggling to keep Magick from headbutting one of the sets of double doors in her eagerness to move on. 

“Release me release me release me release me—” Magick repeats under her breath in between thwarted lunges at the doors. “Foolish elf! We are so close—my mission nears its end—”

“Hope you all are having fun over there,” Hermione says loudly, glaring at the other adventurers. 

“Thanks, we are!” says Tannin. “Let’s check out the tiger face wall now. I bet there’s something cool behind it. So far this room only had that one tiny piece of jade.”

“It’s probably something about the eyes, right?” says Hanamir. “They’re concave while the rest of the shapes on the wall are convex.”

“Okay, Professor *Nerd*,” Tannin says. “You gonna poke the eyes with the pole or what?” 

“Yes,” says Hanamir. He prods the left eyehole with the eight-foot pole and stands back. With a low rumble, the entire stone carving slides into the adjacent wall, revealing a wide corridor with glowing magenta walls.

“Ooh,” says Galadriel. She hops out of the sacrifice passageway and joins the rest of them. Magick even stops berating Hermione for a second and they all peer down into the hallway with very cool lighting.

“Shall we?” says Hanamir. 

He leads them forward cautiously. After about fifteen feet, the floor disappears into a wall-to-wall pit that spans another forty-five feet ahead. There are a few planks across the pit, roughly every five feet. 

“Pretty deep,” Hanamir assesses. “Looks like it goes about twenty-five feet down. Some plants down there, too, and I don’t trust ‘em.” 

The rest of the group joins him at the edge of the pit. The plants are short black shrubs with thorny branches and large yellow blossoms. Colored by the light from the hot pink walls, they look like an interior decorating choice made by an insufferably cool new restaurant. 

“I love it,” says Galadriel. 

“Time for a test,” says Hanamir. He pops back into the Cat Room for a second and retrieves the stuffed cat that had contained the human heart. Then he drop kicks it into the pit. 

Immediately, the black branches of the plants below shoot serious-looking thorns at the cat, impaling it in several places. 

“Motion sensing plants, that’s new,” says Harlan. “Galadriel, you want to risk the walls? Can you crawl fast enough?”

Galadriel places a hand on one wall. 

“Actually,” she says, annoyed, “I don’t think I can stick to these walls, for some reason. They feel like… how walls used to feel.” 

“So do we turn around? I don’t see how we’re getting across,” says Hermione. 

“No, no, they can’t stop me that easily,” mutters Galadriel. “If I can’t climb the walls, I’ll just do a continuous handspring from plank to plank until I’m across.”

“Uh, what?” says Harlan. “Sorry, you’ll do what?”

“You’ll see,” says Galadriel. She walks backward, sticking out her tongue and giving her arms a stretch, preparing to take a running start toward the pit.

“Wait,” says Hanamir. “Let’s tie a rope around you so we can pull you back if we need to.”

“Sounds good,” says Galadriel. She lifts her arms and allows Hanamir to fasten a rope around her waist with a complicated knot. “You can’t hold it taut, though, not until I’m all the way across, or you’ll mess me up.”

“Got it,” says Hanamir. 

“Okay,” says Galadriel, taking a deep breath. She ties her hair back. She shakes out her left leg, then her right leg.

And then she hurls herself into a full sprint toward the edge of the pit, jumping out over the edge as if diving into a pool, but landing on the first plank with her hands and springing forward again, landing her feet on the next plank—this one cracks a little but stays up—and then onto her hands again—the shrubs below are launching thorns at her, but they’re not quick enough—feet, then hands, like a wind-up toy, until she lands on the other side, whooping and cackling in triumph. 

“[Daaaaaaaaaaaamn](https://youtu.be/hHFPuBywhEg?t=3s)!” she cries. “Did you all see that?!”

The adventurers applaud politely, but Galadriel is unsatisfied. 

“Are you kidding me? I just *did* that!” She punches the air. “That was cool as hell!”

“Yes, good work, Gals,” Hanamir calls to her across the pit. He tugs at the other end of the rope. “Untie yourself and attach this to something, and then let us know what you can hear past those doors.”

Galadriel takes another few seconds to cool down, then ties her end of the rope to one of the massive door handles ahead of her. She lays an ear to its surface.

“It sounds like…” Her eyes widen. “Guys, it sounds like the outside world in there. I can hear birds!”

“That is excellent news!” calls Harlan. “Maybe there’s ventilation, and we can take a long rest without poisoning ourselves.”

“Yes, try going in,” calls Hanamir. “And if there’s immediate danger, just do another one of what you did to get over there and come back to us.”

“Oh, sure, I’ll just *do another one*. It’s only the most difficult move I’ve ever done *in my life*. Sure, Hanamir. *No biggie*.”

Galadriel pulls the doors open.

“What do you see?” calls Harlan.

“Oh, wow,” says Galadriel. “There’s been a massive collapse in here! It’s open to the sky.” 

She ventures inside, taking a breath of fresh air for the first time since that morning. She stands still and listens to the trilling of tropical birds and other wildlife moving in the vegetation that has encroached upon the room. 

“It’s a pretty big room… L-shaped, and I’m at the corner… there’s another door leading somewhere else on one side,” she shouts back to them. In the periphery of her vision, she sees a large ape observing her from across the room. It doesn’t look aggressive, but her heartbeat accelerates a bit.

“Okay,” comes Harlan’s voice, faint when competing with the ambient noise of the jungle. “Stay put. We’re going to find a way to neutralize the plants and get across to you.”

Back on the other side of the pit, the adventurers huddle for a brainstorm.

“If I had enough liquid, I could freeze the plants, one by one,” says Tannin. “Everybody take out your flasks, and maybe I can—”


“That is not going to work,” says Hermione. 

“Unshackle me! I will vaporize the plants!” suggests Magick. 

“Also no,” says Hermione.

“Call Lightning?” says Harlan. “I might have to do it a few times, but it’d probably take out a good swath of them at once.”

“Aren’t we worried about the structural integrity of the temple?” says Hanamir.

“Yeah, but it’s *lightning*,” says Harlan.

“My point exactly,” says Hanamir.

“I mean it’s not thunder!” says Harlan.

“I suppose it isn’t,” says Hanamir. “Am I the only one worried?”

Tannin shrugs. Buddy blinks up at him. Hermione is quieting another Magick tantrum and cannot be reached for comment. 

“I’m gonna do it,” says Harlan. He raises a hand, electricity crackling and sparking in his palm. With a gesture like a chef artfully seasoning a dish, he sends a bolt of lightning down to the center of the pit. Several of the spidery-branched shrubs burst into flames, spitting their projectile thorns out uselessly into the walls. 

Harlan smiles, and prepares another handful of lightning. But before he can release it, the ceiling crashes down.
