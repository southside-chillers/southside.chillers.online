[Tannin](/characters/tannin/), [Hermione](/characters/hermione/), and [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) sit in the empty council chamber. Even whispering, their voices echo off the glossy marble.

“Where’d the guy go?” asks Tannin. “The old guy?”

“Nyanceth?” says Hermione. “He went to see Kandir. Said he’d meet us here.”

“Does that strike the rest of you as odd?” Harlan barely voices the words. “He seems to rely on Kandir for, well, everything.”

A goateed man holding a tall silver staff appears in the doorway.

“Guests of the king, you may take your seats,” he says grandly, and bows with a flourish. From behind him, [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) and [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) appear, looking well-rested and eager to catch up. They slide into the row just behind Tannin, Hermione, and Harlan.

“How did it go with the Minister of the Sea?” whispers Hanamir.

“Interestingly,” says Hermione. “Like Deru said, he’s very—”

But she is interrupted by another announcement from the man with the staff. 

“The Minister of War, General Nai Pouru,” he proclaims. The stern-faced woman enters the chamber without looking at the adventurers. She sits at the far left side of the raised, semicircular table at the front of the room.

“The Minister of Trade, Ultas Kandir, and the Minister of the Sea, Haelon Nyanceth.” 

Kandir and Nyanceth walk slowly to their seats together, not stopping their whispered chat. Kandir has a steadying hand on Nyanceth’s stooped back.

“The Minister of Justice, Kir Mirama.”

An elegant woman appears in the doorway and gives a small smile to the room. Tannin thinks to himself, somewhat awestruck, that her cheekbones must be sharp enough to pierce heavy plate armor, or at least scale mail. She carries herself with the confidence unique to individuals of undeniable beauty.

“All rise for His Majesty King [Slee](/characters/slee/) III of Aberith!”

The ministers and the adventurers stand up as King Slee enters the courtroom and takes his seat at the center of the semicircular table. 

“Thank you. Please, be seated,” he says. 

The chamber is filled with the reverberating squawks of chairs against the marble floor as everyone settles again. The tension in the air is like a lute string stretched too tight.

“We are here today because our city is beset by conflict and confusion,” says Slee. “In our chambers with us we have five guests of the crown, who were tasked with investigating the murder of a mutual friend. In pursuing a suspect, they were apprehended. We will hear about the circumstances of that incident today, and the complications that ensued. I now invite General Pouru to explain the order she issued to send these individuals away as prisoners.”

Pouru clears her throat.

“Thank you, Your Majesty,” she says. Her voice is even and strong. “Given the disappearances that have been plaguing our city, and the confession that was overheard by the Amber Guard, it was my responsibility to detain the suspect. These five individuals attempted to obstruct the Guard’s efforts to bring the suspect in for questioning. Therefore, we found it necessary to arrest them as well.” 

“And what of the order to transfer them to a ship, without notifying your fellow ministers or your head of state?” prompts Slee.

“That… that was a mistake,” says Pouru. She seems to lose her train of thought all of a sudden. “I don’t have a… my authority was… it was an error in judgment.”

“This is highly irregular,” says Mirama, the Minister of Justice. She gives Pouru a sharp look. “It is not just a breach of protocol—it’s a betrayal.”

Pouru wrestles with her words.

“I made a mistake,” she repeats. Her face is slack with confusion.

Overlapping voices from the rest of the council grow louder and louder. Hanamir stares at General Pouru, whose downcast eyes and knit brow indicate that her bewilderment is genuine.

“Enough!” says Slee. “I invite our guests to provide their perspective.”

The adventurers share a glance. Galadriel stands.

“I would like to clarify the circumstances of our arrest,” she begins. “The general heard reports that we were trying to prevent the Amber Guard from detaining the suspect. That is not entirely true. We spoke with the Amber Guard, and we acknowledged that the suspect was certainly responsible for the murder of [Bryn](/characters/bryn/) Starloft.” 

She pauses to look at General Pouru, who is staring intently at her own clasped hands on the table.

“But we also told them that the suspect is under the influence of a powerful and unstable magic that has interfered with her state of mind—to such an extent that we think she is not in control of herself. She is traumatized. She needs help. We feared she would be summarily executed without trial, when in fact it would be of greater benefit to Aberith if we were permitted to investigate the underlying cause of her condition.”

The councilmembers take a few moments of silence to digest this. King Slee tilts his head and raises his eyebrows at Galadriel.

“I admit, I’m surprised by this,” he says. “She has confessed to murdering a mutual friend of ours.”

“Sounds open and shut to me,” says Kandir, leaning toward Slee. “If this is a matter of volatile magic, is imprisonment even an option? We’ve contained it for now, but how can we let this creature live?”

Galadriel ignores him and continues addressing the king.

“We cared for Bryn,” she says. “He was a trusted advisor to us during our quest to save the Moon, and because of that, he helped save us all. He was wise, and kind, and he did not deserve to die this way.” She gives that statement a moment to linger in the air, out of respect. “Our position is not that his murder should go unaccounted for. But we think it would be a miscarriage of justice if a helpless person were killed for a crime she was not in full control of committing. And we think it’s important to note that our resident wizard here, Hermione Daydark, believes that if we had access to the suspect alongside an expert magical practitioner, we could track down the true source of her enchantment. And that might lead to the person ultimately responsible for Bryn’s death.”

Slee purses his lips. He seems to be considering her words carefully.

“Please explain why you feel that the suspect is not in control of her actions,” he says.

Galadriel explains: the ever-burning forest fire, the tiefling skeletons, the lone hut spared from the flames. The knowledge that Grizzleby, the red dragon, had killed everyone [Magick](/characters/magick/) had ever known and loved. The erratic bursts of magic that resulted whenever they’d tried confronting her about stealing the dragon book from Bryn, and subsequently killing him...

“The trauma of the loss of her people, combined with whatever magical force has possessed her now, leads us to believe that she may not be entirely responsible for what happened to Bryn,” concludes Galadriel. “She may be the unwitting tool of some more sinister actor.”

Hermione rises from her chair, looking nervous but determined to speak up.

“Our other mutual friend, [the Savage](/characters/the-savage/), was under the control of some dark and powerful magic recently,” she says, “so we know that right-thinking individuals can be swayed to perform acts of evil, through no fault of their own.”

This results in a surge of murmurs from the council, which echo and distort themselves until the adventurers can’t quite make out any of the specific words being said. After a short while, Minister Mirama holds up a hand for silence. 

“What became of this captured creature?” she asks. “She was arrested, but then what?”

Galadriel smirks.

“Your Minister of War can answer that,” she says. 

All eyes turn to Pouru.

“The Amber Guard has the tiefling in custody for questioning as we speak,” says Pouru. 

“But why not question her in front of the council, as is customary?” says Mirama. “This suspect has the right to a fair trial like everyone else in the city.”

Pouru has no response, so Mirama clicks her tongue and turns back to Galadriel.

“What alternate fate do you see appropriate for the suspect?”

“I would hope, with the council’s connections, that we could call in some type of magical consultant who might recommend a course of treatment,” says Galadriel. “She needs the care of an expert.”

“We’d be happy to do the primary diagnostics,” says Harlan quickly. “But yes, our conclusion is that a well-practiced magician would be most helpful.”

Mirama leans back in her chair, looking contemplative, and far more amenable to the idea than anyone else at the high table.

“This is ridiculous!” says Kandir. He throws up his hands theatrically. “The appropriate sentence for the killer tiefling can be negotiated later. The more pertinent issue here is the betrayal of Nai Pouru against the crown. I demand we address this now!”

Slee looks taken aback.

“You’re right,” he says, with a few quick blinks of his eyes. “There has been potential treason without explanation. The hiding of the arrests, and the order to remove the prisoners without alerting myself of the rest of the council, is a grave matter indeed.” He turns to Pouru. “Explain yourself, General.”

“They were to be kept safe on the chartered ship,” says Pouru. “No destination, just outside of the city. Given the strong magic at play, it seemed like the prudent choice for the protection of Aberith.”

“And the lack of appropriate communication was because…?” says the king.

“That was an oversight,” says Pouru, again looking distracted. 

Kandir leans over to Nyanceth, who has dozed off in his chair, and whispers something in the old man’s ear. He jolts awake.

“I have evidence of the intended destination of the ship in question!” Nyanceth sputters. He procures a document from his pocket and holds it aloft in a shaking, liver-spotted hand. Pouru’s face turns pale. “The prisoners... were to be transported to the Northern Ruins!”

Nyanceth hands the piece of parchment over to Kandir, who passes it to the king. The chamber is silent.

“And what else?” Kandir gives Nyanceth a gentle nudge.

“Oh yes!” says Nyanceth, with an enthusiasm that doesn’t quite pass for understanding. “There have been quite a few trips made to this destination in the recent past! Trips that began around the same time as all the disapp—”

“I’ve heard enough,” says King Slee. He is livid, his voice tight and clipped. “Amber Guard, please escort the general out of this courtroom.”

No one speaks as two men in amber robes take Pouru by the wrists and lead her from the high table out through the marble archway. The door closes decisively behind them. 

Kandir gives Nyanceth a satisfied nod. Nyanceth smiles back vacantly.

“It is clear,” says Slee, breaking the silence, “that there must be a thorough investigation of the general’s betrayals. During her absence from the council, I would ask Minister Nyanceth to take on his previous duties as Minister of War.”

It is unclear if Nyanceth understands this, but Kandir claps him on the shoulder in congratulation. 

“In the meantime,” the king continues, “there is still a prisoner who has confessed to murdering a friend of the crown. Let us devote our attention to that matter now. I pose the question to our five guests: do you think it is wise for us to bring the tiefling into this courtroom? Can the creature speak for itself?”

“Indeed, she should be given the chance to speak,” says Galadriel. “But we’ve had some unpredictable experiences with her uncontrolled magic. If any precautions can be taken for everyone’s safety, we would encourage that.”

“Thank you. I will consult with the Amber Guard, and we will make preparations to bring her in. For now, we will take a short recess,” says King Slee. 

He excuses himself and shuts the door loudly behind him. The remaining ministers stand up from the table and follow in his footsteps, with Kandir leading Nyanceth, and the adventurers are left alone in the council chamber.

“Okay, does anyone know what the Northern Ruins are?” whispers Harlan.

“As a matter of fact,” says Hermione, “I do.”

The group huddles closer. She lowers her voice to a near-silent susurration.

“They’re the remains of a forgotten civilization on an island to the north. Thousands and thousands of years old, lost to memory,” says Hermione. “All overgrown and wild now, of course. And I’ve heard stories of the strangest creatures that are said to roam there, but…” Her eyes widen. “Expeditions that have gone there usually don’t come back. Pieces of their ships will wash ashore. So I’ve never made any plans to visit, myself.”

“And that’s where Pouru was planning to send us,” says Hanamir, stroking his chin. “And—if we’re to take Nyanceth at his word—it seems likely that the missing people were sent there, too.”

They think about this in silence for a minute. Harlan shudders, then turns to Tannin.

“Tannin? You’ve been awfully quiet,” he says. “Are you disappointed? Sounds like there would have been lots of great monsters to fight in those ruins.”

“Huh? No. What?” says Tannin. “But—you guys—isn’t the Minister of Justice, Mirama, isn’t she *amazing*?”

“She’s certainly beautiful, if that’s what you mean,” says Harlan.

“Not just that. She’s *amazing*!” Tannin repeats, shaking his head in apparent disbelief.

The chamber door swings open again, and the king and his ministers file back to their seats at the high semicircular table. After them, several amber-robed guards enter, forming a human blockade around a figure who must be Magick. The guard at the back of the group is holding a glowing sphere in the palm of one hand. They stop to deposit Magick in a chair at the center of the room, then walk back to stand at attention against the wall.

The sight of Magick nearly makes the adventurers gasp out loud. She looks emaciated and weak. She can barely hold her head up. Galadriel stands.

“I would like to make the king and council aware that her condition has deteriorated rapidly within the last twenty-four hours,” she says. “She looked healthy and strong the last time we saw her.” She glares at the guards. “What have you done to her? What is that thing he’s holding?”

“That is a precautionary item, an Orb of Antimagic,” explains Slee. “I assure you, it is not harmful. It only prevents the use of magic in its vicinity.” He looks down at Magick with some amount of pity. “Please, identify yourself for the council.”

Magick mumbles something.

“You’ll have to speak up, I’m afraid,” says Slee.

“My name is Magick,” Magick slurs.

“Thank you, Magick. Is it true that you have confessed to the murder of Bryn Starloft?” Minister Mirama asks.

“Yes,” says Magick.

“Can you describe for us what happened on the night he was killed?” Mirama asks.

Magick heaves her head up with effort.

“My only goal is to bring peace to the world…” she sighs. “I thought that I had found a way to do that, but now I think that there is no longer a way.” She swallows drily. “If the death of your friend means that I can no longer live, so be it.”

“May I ask her a question?” says Galadriel.

“Please,” says Mirama.

“Magick, what happened to you since we last saw you? What has made you ill?”

Magick lolls her head in the direction of the adventurers, but speaks to the floor.

“Once you let them get me… it all fell apart,” she says.

“We did all we could,” says Harlan. “Magick, I shackled myself to you to try and get you the best treatment possible.”

Magick doesn’t respond. She slumps further into her chair.

“Magick... do you need magic to survive?” asks Galadriel.

At this, the tiefling displays a flicker of her previous vitality.

“Do you need blood to survive?” she retorts.

“Yes, I do,” says Galadriel. She pauses. “I’m not familiar with tiefling biology. Is that standard?”

From beside her, Hermione shakes her head.

“I require magic to live,” says Magick.

King Slee clears his throat.

“This way that you felt you could bring peace,” he says. “Why was it necessary to murder Bryn to accomplish it?”

Magick takes a long inhale, as if summoning all of her energy.

“I did not mean to kill the scholar. I am sorry. His book helped me to understand… to rid this world of evil we must first rid this world of those who commit evil…” She closes her eyes. “There is an item I seek. A powerful relic of the ancient world. With it I would erase them, dragonkind, from existence.”

Kandir perks up noticeably. He peers closer at Magick as she continues.

“All the texts point me to the ancient island, the place it was last seen… and I sought these people, these friends to help me so that we could bring peace together, but they were angry at me, and I… now I have no more faith in my destiny. Or in the possibility of peace.”

“If this item truly exists,” says Kandir. “Perhaps the tiefling should be allowed to help us find it. It sounds too powerful to be claimed by anyone other than the King of Aberith. If someone with such obvious mental imbalances were to find it, there’s no telling the catastrophe that might result.”

“So you propose a voyage to do... the exact thing the suspect wants to do?” asks Slee.

“The suspect cannot be trusted with it, of course, but if she has already done the necessary research, why not use it?” says Kandir.

“I don’t presume to speak for Magick, but I imagine if you would like her help, you’re going to have to commit to treating her a touch more humanely,” says Harlan. 

“I think we can do that, if she is willing to cooperate,” says Slee.

“Maybe you could send her with people that she already trusts!” says Tannin. The council seems startled, as if noticing his presence for the first time all day.

“Are you volunteering?” Slee asks.

“Yes!” says Tannin, with a thump of his fist on the table. “We’re the very crew to go and find this artifact.”

While Harlan gives Tannin his best “OH REALLY?” face, Hanamir whispers to him in Dwarvish.

“Are you sure you want to go on this side quest and abandon the Lich?” 

Tannin chuckles.

“Whoa! I didn’t know you spoke Dwarvish, my man,” he replies in his native tongue. “Anyway, I’m not planning on abandoning the Lich. I’m thinking we go get this item and then kill the Lich with it!”

“Got it. Good idea, big guy,” says Hanamir. He switches back to Common. “Indeed, we would be grateful for the opportunity.”

Hanamir gives Harlan a reassuring look.

“At the very least, Your Majesty, we can guarantee that Magick will be out of your city and will never return,” says Harlan. “You can trust us to accompany her on this quest, and she will cause you no more trouble.”

“That is my concern at the idea of letting the tiefling go,” says King Slee. He fixes an intense stare on Harlan. “But I trust this party. Will you vow, in the name of your god, that you will keep this tiefling out of the city of Aberith, and deliver the appropriate consequences should she attempt to return?”

He enunciates *appropriate consequences* with precision. His meaning is clear.

“Yes,” says Harlan. “I vow it, in Kord’s name.”
