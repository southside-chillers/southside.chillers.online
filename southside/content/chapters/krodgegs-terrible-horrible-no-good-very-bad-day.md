# [Krodgeg](/characters/krodgeg/)’s house burns down 

We return to the scene with Cal, who has just burned down a house and is now pretending he didn’t do it. The Dragonborn who was inside sleeping now stands beside him in front of the ruins of the structure.

Dragonborn: “Did you see who set the fire?”

Cal *(bullshitting)*: “Yeah… it was someone in blue and white robes. Looked kind of religious, maybe.”

The Dragonborn doesn’t seem to fully buy this. He places a hand on the hilt of his shortsword.

Dragonborn: “All right, which way did he go?”

Cal points in the direction of a nearby alleyway. 

Dragonborn: “Since you’ve been such a help, would you mind coming with me to try and find him?”

Cal: “Sure, give me your contact information and I’d be happy to follow up. Tracking is kind of my thing, actually.”

Dragonborn: “I was thinking we could go now.”

Cal: “Oh. Okay.” He pats his pocket, where [Chunk](/characters/chunk/) is still hiding out in some small animal form that we’ve forgotten to nail down. “Yeah, let’s go see if we can pick up a trail on this guy.”

They set off together toward the alleyway. Chunk finds a moment to sneak out of Cal’s pocket and trail behind them at a distance. Maybe he’s a squirrel? That seems to fit this scenario.

Cal: “So, anyway, I’m not actually that familiar with the city. Are you? Do you know where this alley leads to?”

Dragonborn: “I’m fairly new to the city, and I’m not quite sure what’s down this way either. I just got to town a matter of weeks ago.” He pauses. “You said this guy had blue and white robes on, right?”

Cal: “Yeah, like religious robes.”

They reach the alleyway, which is empty. There’s no sign of anyone, and it ends with a four-foot barrier looking out over a sharp cliff.

Dragonborn: “Doesn’t look like there’s anyone here. You’re sure this guy was alone?”

Cal: “I only saw one person. No idea if he’s alone. But hey, I’m sorry we didn’t find him. You got a place to stay? I can arrange something for you.”

The Dragonborn seems caught off-guard by this offer. 

Dragonborn: “Well, I could use a place to regroup, I guess. But… I have some friends who shared that house with me, and I’ll need to get in touch with them.”

Cal: “Tell you what, I’ve got an idea. How about you come back with me, and leave a message with a neighbor telling your friends where to find you. You can all regroup together and figure out what you’re going to do next.”

The Dragonborn seems cautiously trusting now, and accepts this offer.

Dragonborn: “I really appreciate the generosity. What’s your name?”

Cal: “It’s Cal. You?”

Krodgeg: “Krodgeg.”

# Krodgeg catches a break

Cal leads Krodgeg to the Black Unicorn, which has become the crew’s interim HQ after the Half-Full Flagon burned down. He introduces him to the group and excuses himself to go reserve a room for Krodgeg. In the meantime, [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) tries to get a read on this guy, sensing that something weird is going on. 

Galadriel: “Hey, welcome. What’s your story?”

Krodgeg gives her a short introduction, similar to the one he gave to Cal: he arrived in town a couple weeks ago, he’s been staying with a couple other Dragonborn, and he’s been getting his bearings. The house where he and his friends have been staying burned down, and Cal was kind enough to offer him some aid.

Krodgeg: “So, yeah, I’m just trying to figure out what to do now, because that was the place a bunch of us lived.”

Galadriel: “I am so sorry to hear that. That is devastating. And I know it’s really important to find your community in a new city. None of the six of us are Aberithians by birth, but the city’s a really wonderful place. So we’d be glad to help you guys if you need a friend as you get back on your feet.”

Krodgeg seems genuinely surprised and touched by the kindness he’s being shown today.

Krodgeg: “You know, I didn’t know what to expect coming here to Aberith, but… it’s great to meet people who aren’t afraid of Dragonborn. Most places people aren’t so welcoming to my type. Especially not ones—” He stops short. “I don’t know how much you know about Dragonborn, but there are some that prefer certain types of Dragonborn but not others.”

Galadriel: “I can’t say I’ve met a ton of Dragonborn in my life, but there are plenty in Aberith, especially in the Kiln. May I ask where you’re from originally?”

Krodgeg says the name of a place. It’s in Draconic, which only [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) speaks. At this point, Cal returns with a key to another room and hands it to Krodgeg. 

Galadriel *(butchering the pronunciation)*: “Tooooob? Are the rest of your friends from the tube, too?”

Krodgeg: “Yeah, though I don’t know them all that well. I was sent here, and you know, told that when I got here this would be the place for me. I only met these people once I arrived. But I think some of them did come from the same clan and we live up in Tubé.”

Harlan gives Cal a look, and the two of them leave the room to discuss the Draconic note while Galadriel keeps Krodgeg busy. Cal fills in Harlan on the situation. Harlan takes a look at the Draconic note and translates it. It’s a straightforward letter of introduction that says that Krodgeg will be a good addition to some organization; he has an innate way with weapons and will serve them very well in the upcoming mission. The letter is addressed to someone named [Akra](/characters/akra/). Harlan also translates the name of the place Krodgeg said he was from: it’s something like “the crater.”

Galadriel keeps trying to pull more information out of Krodgeg, but doesn’t get far. The most she learns is that he’s been doing some work underground, but he won’t provide any more details. She gives him the address of a Dragonborn bar, and he’s appreciative of that.

# Krodgeg’s boss yells at him

At this point, there’s a voice from outside the Black Unicorn that’s shouting Krodgeg’s name. From the window, we can see a large, imposing female Dragonborn with one eye. She seems quite upset. 

Krodgeg, looking sheepish, hurries downstairs to meet her. Their conversation is heated from the start. Harlan lurks nearby, not letting on that he can understand what they’re saying. The gist is that she’s upset that the house burned down and that now he’s just hanging out in some bar with some strangers. She says they have work to do, and things they need to get done—they have an entire (unintelligible word in Draconic) to build. 

Krodgeg calls Cal over.

Krodgeg: “I need you to come with me.”


Cal: “Sure, happy to help. Can my friends come?”

There is an extended argument on this point. The female Dragonborn, whom we learn is the one named Akra, does not want to bring anyone but the alleged witness to the fire. At some point, [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) sneakily points the Mirror of the Past at Akra, and sees a few visions:

He sees her growing up in a desolate, icy wasteland.
He sees her as a young adult, fighting in some Dragonborn war.
He sees her take down a full-blooded blue dragon, and as she defeats it, it claws one of her eyes out. 
He sees her being cast out of the Dragonborn clan, and it’s unclear how long ago this was—she looks the same as she does now.

The argument continues, and Cal is now unwilling to go along unless he can bring his friends, citing Akra’s aggressive and threatening posture. At this, Krodgeg sighs, looking sorrowful.

Krodgeg: “This is probably for the best.”

And he exhales a fifteen-foot cone of ice breath, hitting several of the crew. Everyone passes their DEX save except Galadriel, who takes 14 damage. 

Krodgeg grapples Cal and holds a knife to his throat.

Harlan comes clean and addresses the fleeing Dragonborn in Draconic. “I respect your bond to this person, Akra, and I respect that you’ve got to stick together in a city such as this. But violence, and seizing my friend… you can understand why we might retaliate. We don’t want to hurt you and I’m pretty sure you don’t want to hurt us.”

Krodgeg: “Right now… I think your friend’s life isn’t yet forfeit. I think if I bring your friend now and he tells us the truth about what he saw, I think Akra can be convinced to spare him. She’s tough, but she’s fair. But… I don’t think I can make the same promise for the rest of you. If I linger much longer, neither your lives nor mine will be safe.”

Harlan: “All right. Our friend Cal will go with you, but I’m holding you personally responsible for his well-being.”

Krodgeg: “I’ll do what I can.”

# Krodgeg leads outsiders to a secret site

Krodgeg goes with Cal toward the general area of the house that burned down. The rest of the party follows at a distance. They wind up in an area with some run-down buildings and not many people milling about. One of the buildings looks like an abandoned shop. 

Cal: “Look. I know what it’s like to be alone in this world. My family was killed when I was young, and I know it’s not easy. You know, you are your own person, and you don’t have to do anything she tells you. Just follow your own convictions.”

Krodgeg tells him to wait outside the abandoned shop for a moment. He goes inside, and it sounds like something is being lifted. He’s gone for a couple minutes, and returns with Akra and a large male Dragonborn. This new Dragonborn addresses Cal in Common.

“All right. Tell us what you saw.”

Cal: “I just saw a figure in a blue and white robe.”

“And what were you doing in the area?”

Cal: “I was heading back to my friends. I was just out exploring the city.” 

“Did you take anything from the fire?”

Cal: “I mean, a couple of little burns and singes, but that’s about it.”

The Dragonborn is not amused. 

“So, you wouldn’t know, by chance, where the ring that was in the box went.”

Cal: “No, I didn’t see a ring.”

“All right. Empty your pockets, your bags, show us everything you have on you.”

Cal complies, though he knows it doesn’t look good. There’s a vial of Alchemist’s Fire, some caltrops, the construct trap, and some more benign items as well.

“An interesting assortment of items. What is it that you do?”

Cal: “Oh, I’m a hunter, a tracker by trade.”

“I see. And you weren’t able to track the perpetrator of this arson.”

Cal: “Well, I was more concerned with saving the life of your friend, who was asleep inside the house.”

The Dragonborn huddle and discuss this in Draconic. Secretly, Cal holds on to one of his wondrous figurines and prepares to deploy it, if he needs to.
