Chaos reigns in the stone arena. The sound of the newly-amputee Savage’s struggle with the Death Slaad from within the fog does not inspire confidence. The Wyrmling lets out a furious roar as it hits the water. 
 
“[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/)!” the party cries in unison, dreading the horrible sound of dragon jaws ripping through armor like so much metal cotton candy. But all they hear, for now, is splashing.
 
Each non-submerged member of the party leaps into action in a different direction. [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) rushes to the edge of the pit, unrolling his rope down to give Hanamir a lifeline. [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/), by unnatural instinct, scales the wall and perches on the ceiling. She casts a blindness spell on the Wyrmling to buy them some time to regroup. [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) moves toward the fog cloud he summoned, but turns his magic against the dragon, hurling a Sacred Flame in its direction. 
 
The Wyrmling is shocked and enraged. It unfurls its enormous wings and beats the air in powerful bursts, rising from the water to hover in mid-air. Steam surrounds its body like a shimmering veil. Still blind, it falls silent in an attempt to locate its adversaries. It hears Tannin say “Almost there!” as he pulls Hanamir up over the edge of the pit. And then it hears two identical voices, rising in volume and desperation.
 
Two people stumble out of the fog cloud, locked in a very well-matched tussle. They both appear to be [the Savage](/characters/the-savage/). 
 
“That’s the Slaad! I’m the real Savage! Kill it!” says the one on the left.
 
“No! No! It’s taking my form, it’s a shape shifter! Kill the other one!” says the one on the right. 
 
Hanamir wrings out quite a bit of water from one of his sleeves and assesses the two Savages calmly.
 
“Tell us about the last interaction you had with us,” he challenges them. “Tell us about the ring.”
 
Before the Savage on the right can utter a word, the Savage on the left tackles him. Hanamir rushes toward Harlan, and they both prepare to intervene. 
 
But the Wyrmling has heard enough. It blasts fire straight down upon Harlan and Hanamir. The two adventurers fall to the ground and lie there, motionless and smoldering.
 
This could be the end for our heroes, and Tannin and Galadriel know it. From the ceiling, Galadriel fires an arrow at the dragon and pierces it just behind its shoulder. It whips its head around, struggling to pinpoint Galadriel’s location. 
 
Back on the floor, the real Savage shoots a lightning bolt from his hand at the fake Savage, which instantly returns to its true Slaad form. It is mortally injured, but it bites back at the Savage, who is bleeding heavily from multiple grievous wounds himself. Tannin tosses his last javelin at the Slaad and skewers it. It laughs its hideous laugh. It may be close to death, but it makes sure to indicate its scorn for everyone in the room.
 
The Wyrmling perks up at the sound of the javelin flying through the air and snaps its teeth at the space right next to Tannin. He jumps out of the way, but the dragon knows it got close.
 
Another arrow from Galadriel’s crossbow hits the Wyrmling, but falls to the ground. She scurries across the ceiling so the Wyrmling can’t locate her. From a new roost, she casts Healing Word on the Savage, whose bleeding seems to slow. He uses his remaining arm to slice the Slaad, and for a moment, it looks like it might be over for the Aberrant beast. But then it summons a spiteful burst of energy and cold K.O.s the Savage with a swing of its claw.
 
The Wyrmling’s demeanor changes abruptly—it can see again. Tannin turns to face it. He won’t be roasted without a fight. At the same moment, Tannin and the dragon both lunge at each other and miss.
 
Galadriel shoots one last arrow at the Slaad. It slumps to the floor, finally dead. Nearby, Harlan groans. He’s alive! 
 
Tannin and the Wyrmling stare each other down in silence. It’s maybe the most badass moment in the quest so far, and Galadriel gets goosebumps just watching from above. She makes a mental note to write a really cool bard poem about it later, if she lives. In the meantime, she casts Bardic Inspiration on Tannin.
 
The barbarian moves first, landing a mighty blow against the Wyrmling with his battle axe. In retaliation, it takes a bite out of Tannin and comes back with a bloody mouthful of dwarf armor.
 
Galadriel crawls along the ceiling to sit on the chandelier directly above the action. She reaches behind herself to rummage through her backpack, and gives [Buddy](/characters/buddy/) the Pig a reassuring pat on the head before taking out her lute. She starts strumming a fast-paced, rhythmic tune, and the atmosphere in the battle chamber shifts noticeably. Magically, in fact. 
 
She addresses the Wyrmling and begins singing to it in Elvish. It’s a song so insulting, it’s nigh untranslatable. There simply aren’t profanities obscene enough to express in Common what Galadriel sings to this baby dragon—and if there were, you’d have to take a shower afterward to wash off the shame of what you just heard. Imagine the most humiliating and demeaning thing you could say to a juvenile fire dinosaur, right to its face. It’s shocking and, honestly, it’s a bit much. The Wyrmling suffers two points of psychic damage.
 
Galadriel’s vicious mockery of the Wyrmling seems to help Harlan wake up. Through the agonizing pain, he casts Healing Word on his very crispy body and then brushes off some charcoal dust that used to be his outer layer of skin. Good as new, sort of. He busies himself with the medicine kit from his backpack and sets to work stabilizing the ultra-well-done, char-broasted Hanamir beside him.
 
“We’ve got a pulse!” reports Harlan after a few moments of vague ministrations. 
 
Hanamir sits up. He says nothing. His limbs make a disturbing crackling sound as he rises to his feet, draws his sword, and straight up stabs the Wyrmling. The dragon’s blood spurts freely from the incision, but it seems almost too surprised by the turn of events to react. Hanamir, now drenched in dragon blood, lands two follow-up punches before the Wyrmling finally recoils away from him. It hisses something in Draconic, which Harlan promptly translates: _The only way is to burn these guys to a crisp._
 
Galadriel now transitions her psychic assault on the Wyrmling from mockery to something more sinister. There is no more musical accompaniment; there is only a whispered spell that makes the dragon shudder with anguish. Its eyes glow red.
 
Harlan takes the opportunity to slam the Wyrmling with his maul, dealing serious damage. Tannin lodges his axe in the dragon’s back. The Wyrmling is losing control over its movements, but its eyes burn even brighter. Its breath rattles in its throat, a rumble of flames building within. 
 
But before it can exhale, Hanamir’s sword cuts clean through its heart. The Wyrmling falls to the floor, dead, a tendril of smoke rising from its mouth.
 
—
 
No one says anything for a good long while. From the ceiling, Galadriel coughs and brushes smoke away from her face. Hanamir is still sizzling faintly. Over by the corpse of the Slaad, the Savage has woken up and casts a healing spell on himself. 
 
“So,” he says, “how’d you all find me?”
 
Galadriel creeps down the wall to join the group. “Coincidence, actually,” she says. “We’re here to help save the Moon Festival. Something in this tower is exerting an unholy influence on the moon. Isn’t that why you’re here, too?”
 
“Not really,” the Savage says, surprised. “I heard there was a temple of Lolth in this forest. I’m interested in what happened to the followers of Lolth after they were driven from Eillin. Seems a few of them ended up here.”
 
“Ahem. Aren’t you going to thank us for saving you?” says Harlan.
 
“Uh, thank you, I guess,” says the Savage. “But I had it under control when you got here. You kind of… made things worse…” He looks directly at Tannin. “And now I don’t have an arm. But we lived... so.”
 
“You’re welcome!” says Tannin.
 
“I fought my way up through this tower. You probably saw the blood. Killed some priests. Kept fighting until they took me here and threw the gold switch and set this guy on me.” He indicates the dead Slaad.
 
Hanamir finally speaks, his voice tight, as if pushing through an almost unbearable amount of pain to form words. He smells like really good barbecue, and everyone’s thinking it but no one says it. He says: “What’s behind the other door?”
 
“I don’t know,” says the Savage. “All I know is, I killed eight priests. The two I didn’t kill dragged me here and thought they’d let the Aberration do their work for them. But of course, they didn’t know who I am.” He smirks. “So, the moon, huh? What’s going on?”
 
“That’s what we’ve been trying to determine,” says Galadriel. She has taken Buddy the Pig out of her backpack and holds him on her lap, feeding him pieces of a granola bar that she accidentally smushed at the bottom of the bag. “It’s being attacked on two fronts—one here and one somewhere to the east. But here’s what I don’t get. Isn’t Lolth the mother of [Eilistraee](/characters/eilistraee/)? The moon goddess? Why would Lolth’s followers be doing this to the daughter of their goddess?”
 
“Ah, but Lolth _hates_ her daughter,” says the Savage, as if this were common knowledge. “Anyway, I don’t think Lolth is a powerful enough deity to really do damage to the moon. If the Lolth priests are in league with someone else, though, it’s possible. Somewhere to the east, you said?"
 
“Yes. Shargaas temple, we think,” says Hanamir. A puddle of dragon blood is forming at his feet, still dripping steadily from his hair. 
 
“That’d do it,” agrees the Savage. “Interesting. I forget if I mentioned this to you when we first met, but there’s a city out that way that was sealed up long ago to trap the undead inside. The Shargaas folks keep trying to unseal the damn thing. This type of thing, the moon thing, would be right up their alley.”
 
“Want to help us defeat them?” says Galadriel. It might just be the smoke in the air, but she kind of bats her eyelashes at him. “We could really use your help. You’re like… really strong and good at fighting and stuff. Even with one arm, I’m sure you could take them all down…”
 
The Savage knows she’s flattering him, but he is into it. “Ahhhh, I don’t know about all that,” he chuckles smugly. “But here’s what I can tell you. Before they brought me to this arena, they kept me upstairs in their barracks. There are probably six of them up there right now, sleeping, if you want to take them by surprise.” His eyes flicker to the door. “But listen, I really gotta get going. I need to, um, talk to some people.”
 
“Wait,” says Harlan, and takes the green orb out from his pocket. “Before you go, do you know what this is?”
 
“Oh,” nods the Savage. He digs in his own pockets. “Yeah, I found two more orbs just like that here. Onyx and pink pearl. Want them?"
 
“Yes,” says Tannin. He reaches out to grab them from the Savage, but the taller man holds them over Tannin’s head, giving the black orb to Harlan and the pink orb to Hanamir. 
 
In a flash, Harlan sees a fish-like person. Hanamir sees Grumsh, the orc god of storms.
 
“Aw, cool,” says Tannin, obviously annoyed that he didn’t get to have a vision.
 
“Hey, one more thing,” says the Savage. “If the mother of this Wyrmling ever finds out you killed her child…” He looks at Hanamir head to toe. “I just mean... you definitely wouldn’t be so lucky in that encounter.”
 
Harlan wanders to the room where the dragon was held prisoner. The walls are etched with the claw marks of a truly livid animal. The floor is deeply cracked.
 
“What should we do with it?” asks Galadriel. “Hide it? Or are there any uses for dragon scales, or…?”
 
“I’ve fought a mature dragon and lived to tell the tale. Most people do not. Dragons are very intelligent; they understand things we don’t. If this dragon finds you and you try to pull anything shady, it will almost certainly know. If you could somehow convince it that the priests of Lolth were responsible for the Wyrmling’s death, you’d be off the hook. But I don’t recommend trying.” He pauses. “Just make sure it’s never found.”
 
“Is there nothing we can say to convince you to stay and help us?” says Harlan. “Any kind of a trade you might make?”
 
“What do you have?” says the Savage.
 
“A sword,” says Hanamir. “We could tell you the location of a sword.”
 
“What kind of sword?”
 
“A tiefling sword!” says Galadriel. “Owned by some warrior named Valorius.”
 
“Wait. Valorius?” The Savage sounds incredulous. “How do you know?”
 
“Inscription on the blade,” says Galadriel. “Why, is it something you’d want?”
 
“I mean, uhhhhhhh,” sputters the Savage, “if there were any chance that’s _really_ Valorius’s sword, it’s—I mean, it’s a legendary treasure. Value upwards of two hundred platinum.”
 
“Huh, really?” says Tannin. “It wasn’t even enchanted or anything.”
 
“Doesn’t need to be. You guys have never heard of Valorius? Where is this thing?”
 
“It’s in this hut, we met a tiefling—“ Galadriel starts, but Harlan interrupts.
 
“Say you’ll help us, and we’ll tell you,” says Harlan.
 
“A tiefling? Here? Alive? Did you all not notice the abundance of deceased tieflings all over the place in this forest?” The Savage looks skeptical now. “There are no living tieflings here. And no sword of Valorius, either."
 
“It’s real,” says Hanamir, and his stern quietude makes the Savage interested again.
 
“Look, you don’t have to come with us,” concedes Harlan. “But what if we traded you the location of the sword for some more information, or for a favor from that secret order you won’t tell us about?” 
 
The Savage hesitates, then says nothing. Galadriel is growing impatient. She casts Detect Thoughts on the Savage.
 
“He really wants us to leave,” she tells the party. “He killed all but _one_ priest of Lolth—there aren’t six of them upstairs. He’s obsessed with this sword. He really wants to bargain with us for it but doesn’t want to betray his order if the sword’s not really there.”
 
“Okay, fine,” says the Savage, glaring at Galadriel. “You tell me the location of the sword. If I go, and find it, then sure, I’ll tell you something about my order or do you a favor or whatever. But if I go and it’s not there? My order will come to you. And you will not like it.”
 
“It was there when we left it,” says Tannin. “But someone could have taken it by now.”
 
“Do we have a deal or not?” says the Savage.
 
The party considers this a moment too long. The Savage gets impatient himself and casts Detect Thoughts on them all. 
 
“Huh,” he says softly. “How very interesting. Three of you seem willing to make this trade with me in good faith. And one of you knows the sword is not there. In fact, one of you sold it. And was going to lead me on a wild goose chase—and have me betray my _order_ — for _nothing_.”
 
He lets the news wash over them. There are murmurs of confusion and surprise.
 
“Okay, look,” starts Harlan. “I was just—"
 
“What?!” says Galadriel. “You took it? That was your 'private heirloom' you sold?”
 
“It was just going to sit there under a floorboard!” cries Harlan. “I mean, come on!”
 
“We agreed not to take it,” says Hanamir, who—amazingly—is visibly flushed with anger on top of his already gruesome burns.
 
“It got us the Dimensional Shackles!"
 
“Which we didn’t use,” says Tannin, who seems the least fazed by this revelation.
 
“Yeah, but we _might_,” says Harlan. “I did it for us, and I don’t regret it! [Magick](/characters/magick/) is never coming back.”
 
“Congratulations, you played yourself,” hisses the Savage through his teeth. “And you tried to play the Savage. And that just don’t fly."
 
“Oh, please,” scoffs Harlan, starting to lose his own patience. He straightens his back and stares down the Savage. “I’m not trying to get you to betray your order—you won’t even tell us what your order _is_. And frankly, I think you would do well to consider us your allies, because we just fought with you against two hellacious beasts who wanted us all dead. I’m trying to be practical while _all_ of you are being foolish, and meanwhile, our enemies get closer and closer to reaching their goal of destroying the moon. And then we’ll all be sorry. There is a bigger picture here. So think about that, Savage!”
 
This quiets the party, but the Savage is unconvinced. He goes to the body of the Slaad and slices open its stomach.
 
“I sold it to [Sanford](/characters/sanford/) and Son,” says Harlan. “They just left here with it earlier today. See? Is that a sign of good faith?”
 
“That’s nice,” says the Savage. “But it’s too late.” He rummages inside the Slaad’s guts until he finds what he’s looking for: his severed arm, still holding his sword. He waves it at them. “Bye.”
 
Galadriel and Hanamir stand there, fuming—Hanamir literally—while Tannin checks out the remaining locked door. 
 
“Blah blah blah, bye forever, the Savage,” he says. “Anybody curious what’s behind this door?”
 
He puts his ear to it and knocks. An Orcish voice responds:
 
“WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO LET ME OUT OF HERE?!?!”
