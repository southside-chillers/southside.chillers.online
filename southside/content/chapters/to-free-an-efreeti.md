On the way to [Grizzleby](/characters/grizzleby/)'s lair, we discuss bringing Grizzleby a cow tribute. Or several cows! Or, Fibsy suggests, an entire army of ducks (given sentience by a druid)?

A couple miles away from the lair, we know that there's a stream running down from the volcano (presumed to be his lair). The easiest path is going to be to follow that stream. The woods are mostly burnt out; there aren't a lot of creatures around this area. We don't see the giant spiders that used to live in this area--seems Lolth has cleared out. We come to a cave at the foothills of the mountain. We have the option to proceed on foot through the area where the water has cut caves into the mountain, or the area that's more difficult to walk on (lava flow, etc). We're still about 2 miles out from the center of this area.

[Tannin](/characters/tannin/) scans around the cave entrance for footprints. Is it home to something or someone? He rolls a 27 survival with the Blessing of [Istus](/characters/istus/). This cave was carved by water, and it doesn't seem like a creature constructed it. The stream gets somewhat warmer as he explores into it. It probably does lead pretty deep within the volcano. Tannin is excited to go underwater and underground--it's his comfort zone.

[Harlan](/characters/harlan/) is on team "be polite" and wants to make ourselves known before we sneak inside any caverns. The night before we started our journey, he had cast Legend Lore on Grizzleby, and learned: by most accounts, stories say he's an adult (not ancient) red dragon. This is lucky, as ancient dragons are a LOT tougher. He's very interested in powerful opponents, and has prided himself in seeking them out. There are stories from across the continent of him seeking challenges and taking trophies. Lots of local champions have been slain by Grizzleby.

Fibsy suggests we construct a rigged game that we know he can't win. Maybe involving the sovereign glue? Will he keep his word? Red dragons aren't known to be lawful.

We shouldn't appear threatening. We don't want to pique his interest as a challenge.

We buy a very ugly cow for 100 gp to offer to Grizzleby as a snack. Fibsy prepares his Force Cannon and uses his All-Purpose Tool to access Eldritch Blast before we make ourselves known.

Harlan says "O Greatest of Dragons, the mighty Grizzleby, we beseech you to grant us an audience! Please come to the entrance of your cave, we have much of importance to discuss!"

It's quiet, and then the water starts to boil just a little bit. A small magma vent inside the cave turns into a full-blown inferno as a creature seems to start to ooze out of the wall. it starts to take form in front of our eyes, and it's not a dragon... it's a large ifreeti (?), similar to the nereid (water genie) we met, a native of the fire plane. He intorudces himself as sa humble servant of the proud Grizzleby.

"What is your purpose in seeking my master?" he asks.

"We are enthusiasts of the truly powerful," says Harlan. "We've discovered that there is someone of truly great stature who is lording his domination over the southeastern portion of this content. We come here in good faith (points to cow) to parlay iwth Grizzleby and better understand his desire to maintain his authority."

This imposing figure looks at each of us, sizing us up. He turns his attention first to Tannin.

"And what gift did you bring?" he says.

"Ah! So, one gift per person. Well, the cow was kind of my idea," says Tannin. He scrambles through the inventory.

"I once had a name that was feared among my people. A name that many souls were bound to. I was the greatest slaver in the fire elemental plane. but I am reduced to this, a servant with no name." We can sense a bit of humiliation at himself having become enslaved to a creature larger and more powerful than himself.

"Does this bring you fulfillment?" says Harlan.

"This is my life now," says the ifreeti. "I serve my master."

"And if your master should--gods forbid--fall in battle, what would become of you?"

There's a long pause. "Gone are the days when I thought that was a possibility."

"Trust me! We would not be here if we didn't think we had truly found a challenger for the great Grizzleby. Have you even seen the City of the Dead in the southeast? THat is one creepy place!!!" says Harlan.

"The dragon does not tend to get involed in the affairs of men, for he has found that doing so comes with little reward."

"Men, sure! But this guy in the City of hte Dead, he's super powerful, he's got these artifacts... have you heard tell?" Harlan keeps laying it on. He rolls a 21 persusasion.

"Very powerful? Powerful enough to present a challenge to a red dragon?"

"We would not be here were it not for a challenge!" Harlan chuckles.

"And what is the nature of this threat?"

"A Lich with an undead army," says Harlan.

"I will bring my master this news. But understand that it won't be only his wrath that you meet if this information proves to be false." The ifreeti steps away, melding back into the lava flow. He's gone for some time.

During this time, we notice the water continuing to almost-boil. The intensity of nearby magma flows increases. About an hour goes by, and this servant reappears.

"You have permission to approach Grizzleby's throne," he says. He gestures into the cave.

"So that we can be acquainted, my friend, can I call you Ra?" says Fibsy. Not-Ra looks at him and does not reply.

"Oh yeah, that guy's a little too friendly. But if theres any chance your master may engage in a battle he does not win (gods forbid), maybe you could nudge him in the direction of taking that fight?" says Harlan. The ifreeti looks at Harlan with an inscrutable look. He may think that Harlan is dumb.

He guides us through several chambers that widen and narrow along with this completely boiling stream. After an hour of walking, he stops and says that he is not permitted further without an invitation. He will wait here. He's taking an unusual interest in us. He asks if there are any next of kin who should be notified if we should not survive.

We decline, and at that point, he disappears. There's a large stone archway ahead leading to a chamber well-lit by pools of magma on the ground. The stream continues to run through the chamber. There are seven big stone pillars and some rock formations in the room.

Tannin leads the way into the chamber, guiding the cow. We all follow behind him. We see the largest dragon we've ever seen on the magma-pedestal seen in the image. We stand in the lower left corner at the edge of the stream. The ceilings in the chamber are 50 ft high at maximum. The dragon itself is Huge--about 80 feet long. He occupies most of the magma pool.

Tannin continues leading the cow into the room. The cow is not happy about the situation and Tannin really has to wrestle it over toward the pedestal.

"Grizzleby! We meet! And we have a gift. THank you so much for this audience. Before we get started, why don't you help yourself to this tasty hors d'oeuvre?" says Tannin.

Grizzleby lifts an eyelid and takes a look at what we've offered. Then he closes the eye.

"I was told you had something much more interesting to share," says Grizzleby.

"yes of coures," says Harlan. "Well! We have come to you because we are idolators and admirers of those who wield the greatest of power, such as yourself. What we've discovered is pershaps two different entities that could pose a challenge to you. We know it should not stand that they seek to lord their authority over you. We thought perhaps you might seek to bring them low, to show that they don't deserve to be in the same league as you. We recognize our own unimportance here, and seek only to scavenge on the scraps of your glorious victory."

"A Lich, is it?" says Grizzleby. "There's not much fun in killing the undead." His eyes are open now. He looks at Harlan intensely.

"While fighting th eundead might not provide the visceral pleasure of fighting the living, you should understand the power he ahs accumulated. He seeks to spread his power across the southeast. You, surely, are going to be on his list. Do we not all greatly benefit by seeing you lay this Lich low? Truly, you can cast a greater blow for yourself this way."

[Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) beseeches him in a more pleading way, appealing to his potential desire to be loved by a grateful people who have no one more powerful to turn to against this threat. "Oh great Grizzleby, there is no one else that we can turn to. While we know that your interests are your own, there is so much to be said for the love and gratitude of an entire people. They would see you as a leader."

"CAn you imagine the trophy? An entire city taken by you?" says Fibsy.

"And all of this pales in comparison to another... have you heard tell of the great monster [Kandir](/characters/kandir/)?" says Harlan.

During all of this, Grizzleby has watched us interact with each other. He seems mildly amused by our theatrics. The mention of Kandir though... he does seem to lose his composure. He turns his head quickly and breathes a small amount of flame. A reminder o fhis innate powers.

"And what does he have to do with this? What does that... betrayer... have to do with any of you?"

"This traitor is not content to live in infamy. Instead, he spurns your very name. He seeks to accrue more power. He has ransacked a nearby city, taking its most powerful artifacts. He is pursuing more. I know he is no match for you, but what a victory it would be to take down this beast who is insulting not just your name, but everyoneo n this continent." says Harlan.

"Kandir possesses abilities beyond any man I've met," says Grizzleby. "I'm not sure if he sent you here or what personal stake you all have with him. Most that would meet Kandir."

Galadriel starts on a rant about his crimes in Aberith, but Grizzleby interrupts. "I care not for politics, only for the reason why you all are willing to risk certain death to take him down."
Galadriel, "Can we tell you about the grudge we hold against Kandir. This man poisoned the city council of a good king..."

Griz interrupts, "Why have you all come to near certain death to stop him?"

"We can only be happy once we see his smoldering corpse," says Harlan. "I think we would all like to hear the story of how he betrayed you, so we can appreciate your certain victory over him."

"The one that smells of water," says Grizzleby. Tannin raises his hand. "You are a Dwarf?"

"Aye, that's right," says Tannin.

"And you've spent time somewhere other than here," says Grizzleby.

"Not entirely by choice, but yes.'

"A slave?"

"An unwitting traveler who was taken in."

"You see, I've promised my loyal servant that he may someday return the plane of fire that he is from. And in doing so, he may retake what is rightfully his. All of that plane under his control. But he has an issue, whic is that he is still very indebted to me. He has offered you and your friends as his replacements to pay his debt. He promised me one that could infiltrate the Elemental Plane of Water, and five others that could help me bring this Lich to my trophy room. But now you speak of Kandir... and it seems tat perhaps I have a use for all of you, if you have a personal connection to this one. So, I will watch as you all earn your freedom."

"We could just perform this task for you?" says Harlan. "How about that?"

"You will earn your freedom," says Grizzleby again.

The ifreeti steps into the room brandishing a large scimitar. Grizzleby indicates taht he will watch us all fight and decide what happens based on the outcome of this. He lets out a mighty roar and the entire mountain seems to shake. Harlan is knocked prone.

Initiative order

Galadriel
Fibsy
Ifreeti
[Chunk](/characters/chunk/)
Harlan


Galadriel crushes the ifritti's mind, muddling its thoughts. It has to subtract points from all its rolls for a minute unless it succeeds on an INT save. He also takes 30 points of psychic damage.

Fibsy moves into range and uses Eldritch Blast on the ifritti. Both his hits succeed; doing 14 pts of force damage. The Eldritch Cannon as a bonus action for another 15 pts of force damage.

The ifritti creates a Wall of FIre between himself and everyone else. A 60-ft long wall appears with fire coming out of one side.Everyone but Fibsy makes a DEX save. Harlan and Chunk take 27 fire damage.

Chunk casts Lightning through the Wall of Fire. He saves, so takes half damage for 19.

Slightly singed and still prone, Harlan dusts himself off. He stands up and backs away from the Wall of Fire as much as possible. "YOu wanna go back to the plane of fire, huh?" he says, and tries to cast Banishment on the ifreeti. He fails his save... and is BANISHED!!!!

Knowing that the ifreeti has been banished, Grizzleby steps down and stands right behind all of us. He spreads his wings so that they stretch out almost to engulf the whole party.

"Congratulations, you have earned your right to work for me. You will take the place of what you took."

It's pretty clear he now views us as his slaves. Ruh-roh!!!

"it isnt often that some as powerful as you all offer themselves to my service. I should thank you," says Grizzleby. He gestures toward a small hallway a little bit behind the cave door, inset into the rock near his throne. He indicates we're free to take some things from his stash. But yeah, we're here to serve him now.

"We are truly excited to be performing these services for you, great Grizzleby," says Harlan. "We besseech you, any information you have that might help us find the traitorous Kandir?"

"He was on a quest to collect some artifact that he should not possess. He has one that allows him to always be creating a new body to be born into upon his death. I would recommend that hwen you go to fetch him for me, you bring the extra body as well."

(He's always growing a new body that if he dies, he's born into. Weird!!!)

"It was you all that said he reside din the City of the Dead, was it not?" says Grizz.

"We clearly do not match your level of power ,and we wonder why you choose to send your minions out instead of taking the glory for yourself?" says Harlan.

"I'm not a guy who eats out a lot," says Grizzleby.

"But the fame! The glory!" says Harlan.

"When I kill kandir, and the continent is ruled by me, people will know my name," says Grizz. "As for where he is, I would recommend that you pay a visit to this lich. For I do believe that this city you speak of is where he obtained the artifact that gave him this most pesky ability. And hving killed him several times, I find the fact that you all are collecting artifacts yourselves to be somewhat useful to me."

"And this undead usurper, you have heard tell of his exploits? Any wisdom to grace us with? On his phylactery?"

"The Lich is a pathetic man," says Grizz. "Too attached to the idea of life to live. I have seen that you all are most powerful, and will have no difficuly retrieving the info you require from him. And if you do... oh well."

"Might we call on you from afar if we need your assistance?" says Harlan.

"Absolutely! here's a whistle!" He pauses. "NO! YOU WORK FOR ME!"

Harlan tries again, saying even he is able to contact Istus.

"Istus serves me too" says Grizz.

SO I'll have her pas syou a note! says Harlan. Grizz says nothing; Harlan backs down.
