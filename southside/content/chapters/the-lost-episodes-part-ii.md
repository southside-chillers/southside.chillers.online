The following is a transcript of an interview with Philtlanextli, an ancient Olmen man who observed the Southside Chillers as they passed through his chamber. Due to the nature of his enchantment, the reader may find his answers evasive or otherwise unsatisfactory. Descriptions of nonverbal communication have been included where helpful. Some passages have been edited for clarity.

**For those at home who may not know you, would you mind introducing yourself?**

Command me to answer and I shall.

**Oh, whoops, that’s right. I have a spell scroll for this.**

Command me to answer and I shall.

**I speak one word; heed what I say.**
**What I command, you must obey.**

Command me to answer and I shall.

**Answer!**

Hey.

**Hello… Philtlanextli?**

Yes.

**Did I say that right?**

You can call me Phil.

**Great. Um, for those at home who may not know you, would you mind—**

Introducing myself? Yeah, I heard you before. I just can’t respond until you Command me.

**Gotcha. Okay. So… can you? Introduce yourself?**

Mmhmm. Well, I’m Phil, and I’m the one who lives in the black mirror. 

**And can you tell us what the black mirror is?**

It’s… hmm. It’s a mirror, and I guess its surface is black. I am ninety-*nine* percent certain it’s hanging up on a wall.

**How did you get in there?**

I’m afraid I’m not sure of that either. Sorry.

**That’s all right. Do you remember ever not being there?**

I think so.

**What was your life like?**

I was just... a guy. You know? *(he pauses)* You know.

**Okay. Let’s see. What can you tell me about the last people to come through your room?**

Hmm.

*(moments pass)*

**Take your time.**

First, they dipped a lot of things in the tub.

**Set the scene for us, if you could.**

There’s a tub in the room.

**Okay, continue.**

The first thing that happened was that the big one with the teeth dipped a rod in there, and it turned to gold. He’ll see.

**See what?**

Oh, just wait.

**No, but I haven’t—I haven’t dipped anything into the tub. Can you just tell—**

I simply can’t say. You’ll have to wait and see. *(he winks)*

**Fine. What next?**

The one with yellow hair dipped her shoe and a strand of her hair. *(he giggles)*

**And you won’t tell me why that’s funny?**

*(he giggles)*

**Just assume I want you to continue describing what happened next until I tell you otherwise, okay?**

That wasn’t your command. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

**Please continue describing?**

They looked at the Water Mirror next, but the short and bearded one resisted its power. And then the one with blue hair conjured a small creature and banished it there. It has surely drowned. 

**Oh dear. Did you get a look at the creature? Was it a prairie dog, by any chance?**

It… no.

**All right, then what happened?**

The yellow-haired one touched my neighbor. My good-smelling neighbor.

**Who is your neighbor?**

Who *was* my neighbor!

**All right, who was your neighbor?**

I don’t know! He smelled of spices! *(he is visibly agitated)*

**What happened to him?**

She touched him, and he fell out of his home! His [wall home](https://imgur.com/gallery/nUoaFR0), just next to mine! And he was crushing her stupid—weak—little—stupid—stupid body just fine until the other ones had to hack him to pieces!

**Are you all right?**

*(he screams)*

**I’ll let you have a minute to yourself.**

**Thanks for agreeing to continue speaking with me. I didn’t mean to upset you earlier.**

Mmm.

**All right, so, would you be comfortable telling me what the Southside Chillers did next?**

They passed through my neighbor’s home into the dance closet.

**And what is that?**

It’s a closet where you have to dance the whole time with as many legs as you have.

**Anything else?**

They came back soon enough. Nobody likes it in there. And after that, it was all about the mirrors with these folks.

**Did they speak to you?**

Yes, but they didn’t understand that they had to Command me, even though that is the first thing I say. It’s like... no one listens.

**But they figured it out eventually, right?**

Eventually. First they looked into the Fire Mirror and saw death.

**Can you be more specific?**

They looked inside it and it showed them some different ways to die.

**Are these visions rooted in any kind of divination, or are they just illusory?**

*(he giggles)* You’ll see.

**Ah, that again. Well, all right. Tell me about the conversation you had with them.**

The priest was the one who Commanded me to answer. The rest of them wanted to do silly things. One of them made my glass frosty. Some of them wanted to proceed without talking to me.

**Would that have affected their quest in some way?**

I gave them good information. I told them that the object they were seeking is in the room beyond this one.

**But that’s where they were going anyway, right? So they would have found it whether or not you said that.**

Do you want to know what else I said or not?

**Yes, yes, sorry. Go ahead.**

I told them the final chamber would exploit their strengths. And that the thing inside was sealed away for a reason. I warned them not to go in.

**But were you vague about it? Because I can see that not being very persuasive, especially after they’d gotten this far.**

Yes, I was very vague.

**Okay. Did they ask anything else of you?**

They wanted to know if they had what they needed to succeed, and I told them they had *more* than they needed. Because I do like to lift people up sometimes.

**But you still didn’t want them to go in, right?**

I mean, I told them that my own civilization destroyed itself wielding this powerful item they were seeking. Not in any amount of useful detail. But I did tell them that.

**Can you give me any useful detail?**

No. Just ominous proclamations.

**Like what?**

My people made many mistakes with this item. We used it too many times. Brought things from distant lands that gave us great wealth and power. But things came that should not have come. I could tell that these dumb oxen would meet a similar fate if they were to succeed in finding this item. 

**All right. But they went through anyway?**

They sure did, I tell you what.

**And were their strengths used against them, as you predicted?**

I don’t know what ultimately happened to them. They left two of their party behind in the dance closet. A terrible horned woman and a pig.

**Was this based on your warning, do you think?**

Maybe. The woman was strong. I don’t know about the pig. Would have to be a strong pig. 

**He is.**

You know the pig?

**I do.**

How is the smallest one the strongest? Tell me more. 

**He’s a really special guy.**

I get it! I see what you’re doing! You wanted me to be more specific, and I wouldn’t, so now you are doing the same to me! Ha! Ha ha ha!

**Guilty. Thanks again, Phil. I wish you the best.**

Leave me now. Ha! Ha ha ha ha ha!
