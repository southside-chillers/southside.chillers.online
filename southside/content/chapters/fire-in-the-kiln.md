“[Tannin](/characters/tannin/), wait!” 

[Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) scrambles after him. He’s pushing past a group of hooded goblins near the exit.

“Sorry,” she says to them as she follows in his footsteps. They grumble at her, shaking their heads and straightening their cloaks. “Tannin, let’s catch up with [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) and the others first—”

The night air outside the Black Unicorn is chilly. When the door closes behind her, she realizes Tannin is nowhere to be seen. A smoky scent is on the wind. 

“Passing Without Trace,” says a quiet, familiar voice in her ear. 

“Oh!” she says. “Where…”

In the next moment, she feels herself absorbed into the rogue monk’s signature spell. The noise from the bar is dampened, and the rest of the party is suddenly visible around her.

“The clown and his associates are aware that they’re being watched,” says Hanamir. “They’re en route somewhere—a safe house, if I had to guess. [Harlan](/characters/harlan/)’s quick thinking in casting Locate Object on the clown’s robes will help us track them.”

Harlan’s eyes are closed. He nods.

“They’ve turned another corner,” he says. “And now… I think they’ve gone inside a building. It looks like the robes are descending a staircase.” He frowns slightly. “And, all right, now they’re not moving. Either the clown has changed into a different outfit, or he’s sitting still.”

“Let’s go find out,” says Tannin. His eyes glow with excitement.

“Can you lead us there?” asks [Chunk](/characters/chunk/). 

Harlan points to the right. 

“This way,” he says.

The adventurers begin walking down the alleyway, keeping their voices down, even though the effect of Pass Without Trace keeps them safer than any of their own sound modulating efforts. Harlan leads them on a twisting path through the Kiln, past the livelier areas and into the narrow and unlit alleyways that seem designed specifically for covert crimes to be committed therein.

“It’s this one,” whispers Harlan, nodding at the building before them. Several boarded-up windows dot the facade. In front, there’s a darkened staircase leading downward, with no ground-level entrance to be seen.

“Um,” says [Hermione](/characters/hermione/), “I do not like this.”

“I do,” says Tannin. “All right, I’m going in.”

Hanamir pulls him back before he can escape the Pass Without Trace field.

“Just a moment,” he says. “Let’s not be hasty. Galadriel, would you mind spider-climbing around, checking for more exits?”

“On it,” she says. She returns, minutes later, shaking her head. “This place is not up to any sort of fire code. Just the one doorway. All the windows boarded.”

“What’s our plan, then? I’d like to listen in, first, if we can, before we bust in the door on a building full of clowns,” says Harlan.

“Yes, let’s approach this doorway with an abundance of caution,” says Hanamir. “Unless you all have any objections, I’ll go first.”

The other adventurers shake their heads in unison, and Hanamir tiptoes down the staircase, keeping close to the left-hand wall. He holds up a hand behind him indicating that the others should stay back while he rests an ear to the door. He jogs back up the staircase after a moment.

“Voices,” he says. “Indistinct. Sounds like three or four individuals. I’m going to pick the lock, and if things go bad… well, Tannin, I’ll flash you the ‘murder everyone’ signal.”

Tannin nods.

Hanamir returns down the stairs and, in seconds, has pushed the door open just a crack. He presses against it with his fingertips, revealing a hallway beyond, a millimeter at a time. It is dimly lit by flickering candlelight from a room he can’t yet see.

“...completely unacceptable. And after the debacle in the Flats?” 

“We just want to make sure it goes smoothly, that’s all. And that will probably take longer than two weeks—”

“Smoothly? Yeah, it’d better. There’s no room for error in what’s left.”

Hanamir creeps down the hallway and peers around the corner. Four people sit at a table in a large, mostly-unfinished basement. There are two clowns: the one in green and white, whose robes Harlan tracked, and one in blue and purple, who is delivering this tirade to the others. There is one man wearing Amber Guard robes, and there is one man dressed as a civilian—a well-to-do one, certainly out of place in an area like the Kiln.

The blue and purple clown turns his attention directly to the Amber Guardsman.

“You need to go and figure out what other resources you can bring.”

As the amber-robed man gets up from the table as if to leave, Hanamir darts back down the hallway and up the staircase. 

“A renegade Amber Guardsman approaching from downstairs,” he reports. “Two clowns and a clown-allied civilian remain.”

The adventurers scurry to find advantageous positions around the doorway.

“Chunk!” hisses Harlan from behind a trash can. “Come stand by me!”

Chunk is lingering by the top of the staircase, just barely out of view.

“Nah,” he says, and brandishes his club. “I’m gonna try and whack ‘im when he gets up here. One and done.”

“Are you *sure* you—”

“Hate to say it in front of your friend here, but it’s how I always used to knock out the hogs, you know, after I’d wrassle ‘em, so’s we could cook ‘em—”

The Amber Guardsman’s footsteps pause a moment on the stairs, and for a second, Harlan thinks Chunk’s farmyard memories might have cost them the element of surprise. But then the steps resume. As the top of a head appears, Chunk’s club connects with it in a powerful, well-placed blow, and the guardsman falls prone on the ground.

“Aw, yeah, got ‘im,” says Chunk, clearly pleased with himself. He whistles.

“Shh, quiet, quiet,” whispers Harlan, raising his hammer. “I mean, good job, Chunk, but we don’t want his friends downstairs to suspect anything’s amiss—” He brings down the hammer and further ruins the Amber Guardsman’s night. 

Not willing to have his thunder stolen, Tannin flings himself forward and stabs the guardsman in the thigh with his trident. 

“Is he dead yet?” asks Hermione. She’s keeping her distance.

“Not yet,” says Tannin. “Let me just pull my trident out of his leg here and get another good stab to the viscera.”

Before he can do this, a blast of thunder knocks them all backward onto the pavement.

“Take care of them!” shouts the green clown, emerging at the top of the stairs. “Make sure no one gets away!”

Harlan picks himself up off the ground with an expression that illustrates his particular chagrin at having Thunderwave used against him. He casts Sleet Storm at the area where the green clown stands. A deluge of spiraling wind and freezing rain surrounds the clown and makes the staircase treacherously slippery. 

In the meantime, the Amber Guardsman drags himself forward and raises himself to his knees, wincing. He’s holding a smooth stone in his right hand, flipping it over in his shaking palm. He looks up at Tannin, closest to him, who is already back on his feet and reaching for his trident again. 

“How much do you value your life?” says the guardsman. It’s an odd question, Tannin thinks, coming from a man who appears to be inches from death himself.

Tannin’s nostrils flare.

“I value every day that I get to take out scum like you,” he says.

Through the blood that trickles down his face, the guardsman smiles. He glances back at the doorway and gives the green clown a look that Tannin can’t decipher. Then he pockets the stone. Trembling, he points a finger at his own chest.

Fire rips through the alleyway. Tannin feels a crush of searing heat knock him down like an ocean wave, back when ocean waves used to knock him down.

How long is it until he can hear again? He can’t tell. His vision—when he can open his eyes—is blurred. He can see the shape of Hanamir somewhere beside him, unconscious. With effort, he turns to look behind him, and sees Harlan and Hermione lying motionless. Only Chunk and Galadriel show signs of responsiveness.

With the break in Harlan’s concentration, the Sleet Storm in the doorway is gone; billowing steam takes its place. There is nothing but a scorched shape on the ground where the Amber Guardsman once knelt. 

Still lying on the ground, Galadriel casts Cloud of Daggers at the doorway, where the green clown has taken cover. But Tannin can tell she’s moments from collapse. Chunk rises to his hands and knees slowly. The party’s chances, Tannin thinks, are not looking good.

For whatever reason—his hardy dwarven constitution, or the strength of his desire, nay, his *need*, to obliterate these clowns, or perhaps the poetic irony of being the closest to the origin point of the detonation, the one who *should* have been taken out the hardest—Tannin’s the one with the most fight left in him. And he knows it.

He flies into a rage.

His trident lies beside the charred remains of the guardsman, magically unscathed. He heaves it over his head and charges toward the staircase, bringing it down into a savage jab to the green clown’s gut. It hits, and the clown topples backward down the stairs. Tannin thinks to himself that this would be funny if he weren’t so angry. In fact, he realizes, it’s all he’s ever wanted out of a fight: a foe whose comedic misfortune underscores Tannin’s own cosmic dopeness.

As he falls, the green clown casts Thunderwave again. Tannin’s trident disconnects from his abdomen, and the force throws him back to the pavement in a manner that he expects will result in a gnarly butt bruise. He checks behind him: Galadriel joins the ranks of the unconscious while Chunk hangs on. But there’s no time to help his friends yet. It’s do or die.

He catapults himself down the stairs. The scant lead the clown had on him is nullified as Tannin crashes through the doorway. He breathes, if only for a second, and looks around. He’s in a large, unfinished basement, lit by candles on a table. He sees the green clown clutching at his three-pronged stomach wound. The posh-looking civilian holds a flimsy chair in front of him, his face white with alarm. The second clown Hanamir mentioned is nowhere to be seen.

But in this moment? Tannin’s gonna dance with the clown that brung him.

“RRRAAAAAAAAAARGHHHH!!!” he bellows, and launches his trident with all of his might at the green clown. It impales him. Before the clown can even look up in shock, he is flat on the floor, looking pretty decisively deceased. 

“Nice,” says Tannin. He walks over to check his work (and retrieve his trident). It’s true: the green-and-white clown, the one who was set to deliver payment to [Tord](/characters/tord/) after the explosion in the Flats, and who appeared with a posse at the Black Unicorn just tonight, has shuffled *hard* off this mortal coil.

“Cool,” Tannin reiterates. 

The wealthy-looking man with the chair has backed up toward a door at the opposite corner of the room, and takes this moment to drop his makeshift shield and flee.

“Not so fast, fancy boy!” growls Tannin.

He gives chase. It’s not challenging in the slightest to catch up to the man, whose nerves have him stumbling over his own feet. 

“Wait!” cries the man. “Can we just talk—”

Tannin takes a running leap and tackles him.

“Yeah, we can talk,” he says. “My friends are good at talking. You’re gonna talk to them about what you were doing down here with these *actual*...” he breathes heavily, as if it’s difficult to even spit out the word. “...*clowns*.”

And with that, he clocks him on the head with the blunt end of his trident. 

---

Chunk has some skill at tending to sick and wounded animals back on the farm, but it’ll be tough, he thinks, to help out here. He can’t even see straight after that blast knocked him sideways, much less administer life-saving treatment. He inches his way over to Galadriel. She’s bad off, but not as bad as the others. Just a nudge and a whiff of some smelling salts from his herbal kit and she’s back, blinking and sputtering. 

“Thanks, Chunk,” she says. “Oh, jeez. Is everyone out cold? Where’s Tannin?”

“He went after the clown,” says Chunk. 

“Of course,” she sighs. “All right, let me see if I can muster up some healing for these guys.” 

“Yeah, we’re gonna need more than one mender, I reckon,” Chunk says.

They get to work at stabilizing Hanamir, Harlan, and Hermione. After a few minutes, the full party is conscious again, but not much more than that can be said for them.

“I said… I was done… with the public… brawls,” gasps Hermione, upon waking.

Harlan checks his own pulse. 

“Am I alive?” he wonders out loud. He checks his own pulse again, unsatisfied.

“Seems that way,” says Hanamir. 

A steady thudding noise comes from the staircase. The adventurers hold their collective breath.

In front of the derelict building, Tannin emerges, dragging an unconscious person and a dead clown behind him, one hand gripping each of them by the collar. He is fully soaked in blood with streaks of green clown makeup staining his skin.

“Time to go,” he says.

“Go where?” asks Hermione.

“[Mirama](/characters/mirama/)’s house,” says Tannin. He glances down at the bodies. “She owes me a favor or two.”
