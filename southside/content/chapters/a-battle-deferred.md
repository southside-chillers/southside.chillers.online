## Escape from the Half-Full Flagon

- The inn is on fire! And is under siege by six or so of [Bracket](/characters/bracket/)’s metal constructs.

- Instead of confronting the constructs, we decide to flee. 

- We lose most of the hostile machines, but there are two that follow us from the Flats to the Kiln. 

- [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) remembers the location of some Amber Guard outposts in this area, so we decide to lure the constructs past an AG outpost in the hopes that the guards will subdue them.

- The guards do take care of the constructs, and also shout at us to stop. But we disregard that. One of the AG stays with the constructs, and the other pursues us. [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) tries to keep an eye on him, but he slips away and we’re not sure where he went. Maybe invisible?

- We toss the amulets into a fountain as we continue running. We believe them to be connected to the constructs, so if they’re tracking us that way, they won’t be able to.

- We split up, briefly, to throw the one AG off our trail (*if* he’s still pursuing us). Cal goes the woods, Tannin jumps in the river, the rest of us go different directions in the Kiln. After a little while, we meet back up at the Black Unicorn and rent a room.

---

## Rest, at last

- We take a long rest at the Black Unicorn and discuss options for the next day. We talk about taking out [Kaz](/characters/kaz/) first, but then decide the threat of Bracket is maybe more immediate and easily dealt with. 

- We spend the next day psychologically preparing ourselves to have the battle we ran away from at the Flagon.

- Cal finds a place in the Kiln willing to sell him some acid and some Alchemist’s Fire, for use against machines (and potentially to make good on his threat to burn down Bracket’s shop). He uses the 35 platinum he stole from the Prismatic Inn to pay for all this.

- We wait until nightfall to go back to Bracket’s shop for what we hope will be a surprise attack.

## Bracket’s Workshop II: Rise of the Machines

- Tannin, who is all about the nostalgia lately, leads the charge with his portable ram. He breaks down Bracket’s door easily. [Chunk](/characters/chunk/) transforms into an ape to provide some extra muscle as the team goes in.

- We hear some scrambling from the basement workshop. It does appear that we’ve caught Bracket by surprise.

- Tannin leads the way downstairs, followed by [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/), Cal, and Chunk, with Harlan and [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) bringing up the rear. We see Bracket hastily putting on some armor.

- Bracket then pops open a barrel and releases some mechanical snakes, which slither toward us up the stairs. A mech-snake bites Cal, who takes some poison damage. 

- Chunk throws a rock at a mech-snake, while Harlan casts Healing Word on Cal.

- Galadriel tosses some acid on a snake, which does take damage, but it also splashes a little on Tannin.

- Tannin is not perturbed by this, and decides to try tossing his bomb into the furnace. He misses, however, and the bomb just falls to the floor, unlit.

- Bracket uses one of his amulets to command a guardian construct to retrieve the bomb and hold it out of everyone’s reach. Bracket then moves as far away from everyone as he can in the close quarters of the workshop.

- Meanwhile, the snakes continue attacking Hanamir, Cal, and Tannin, who are at the front of the group.

- Harlan casts Sacred Flame on the remaining snakes. One more of them is destroyed. 

- Galadriel climbs up the wall and onto the ceiling. She gets above Bracket and then drops down onto him, touching him so as to cast Bestow Curse. But Bracket passes his saving throw, so the spell fails. Galadriel is just hanging onto the gnome’s armored shoulders now, I guess. She uses her bonus action to grant Tannin bardic inspiration.

- Tannin then charges forward to attack Bracket, and makes a few hits. But it seems like the guardian construct maybe absorbs some of the damage for Bracket, which is an interesting wrinkle.

- We end mid-battle, with Bracket coming up next in initiative order.
