# A split-party compromise

The titans (a.k.a. femorians) lead the party into the mountain with the rabbit cart. The city within is carved from the inside of the mountain. It looks like they just clawed at it for centuries—it's not an advanced architectural feat like the dwarf city. They bring us along a path lined with bones and animal carcasses toward an imposing, jagged structure with a throne made of tiberium, where the king of the titans holds court. He surveys us and gestures to the cart full of tiberium.

**Titan king:** Little giant… littler friends… where did you get this fortune?

**Chunk:** We bring this as an offering of peace. We can give you more of this.

**Titan king:** Why should I not chain you up with the other dwarves?

**Chunk:** You’d be within your rights to do that. But we’re hoping we could be partners, to get you more of this precious mineral.

**Titan king:** I will send one of you to show my scouts where there is more. The rest of you stay… as my guests.

We make a compromise. Two of us (Galadriel and Tannin) can go with the scouts, and two of us (Chunk and Harlan) must stay as "guests." Hanamir remains outside the city.

Harlan and Chunk are brought to a deeper part of the mountain. They are enlisted in a chain gang of dwarf prisoners. 

- Yikes!

# In search of tiberium

With Hanamir following behind at a distance, Galadriel and Tannin lead two titan scouts toward the river with the kraken. Their tentative plan is to bamboozle the giants by telling them the tiberium is in the water, and hopefully give them the slip when kraken gets them. The journey to the river will take 3-4 days. 

**Galadriel:** (whispered, to Tannin) How gullible are they? Are they at all chill? Do they party?

- They are not at all chill. They’re brutal, powerful, and only one of them speaks passable Common. 
- They’re not cautious as they travel: they just kill things (a couple of meanlocks, for example). 

Tannin tries to "big dog" them. He demonstrates his strength by ripping a tree stump in half. 

- There’s some respect for this, but then one of the titans uproots an entire tree and rips that in half. 
- Galadriel declines to demonstrate to anyone how weak she is.

So we are utterly bested strengthwise, but they seem like maybe they’re a little bit dumb, or at least, not as sharp as Tannin and Galadriel.

Meanwhile, Hanamir points the Mirror of the Past at the communication stone from the Amber Guard guy who blew himself up. He sees a rack of the stones, like walkie talkies, at Amber Guard HQ, confirming it was a real official one. The mirror shows mostly uninteresting visions of guards using it.

We reach the river after about 4 days.

# Intel-gathering among the dwarf prisoners

Meanwhile, Chunk and Harlan are doing hard labor. It's mostly breaking stones and digging long tunnels underground. There isn’t much time that’s unsupervised. They sleep in a room with other prisoners and are watched by guards.

Chunk finds opportunities to show his ring to other dwarves.

**Chunk:** Hey, I'm a guardian. We’re gonna get out of here. Wanna come with me?

The dwarves' faces show a glimmer of recognition, then confusion. 

**Dwarf:** Where'd you get that?

**Chunk:** Long story, but I’m a new guardian. Passed my trials a couple weeks ago.

**Dwarf:** But you're not a dwarf. And you got captured, too?

**Chunk:** No, this was planned. We’re infiltrating. We can leave anytime, right? 

He wiggles his ring finger. The dwarf seems panicked, and looks toward the guards.

**Dwarf:** Watch it! We can't leave. We’re sworn to protect the rest of these prisoners. It doesn’t seem like the right thing to do.

**Chunk:** Wow. OK, that’s commitment. I gotta know: is the king here?

**Dwarf:** No, the king never got captured. 

- There is the sense that this could be a lie. 

**Chunk:** What's the deal with tiberium? Is it really special, or is it worthless? Is there a ritual they do with it, or something?

**Dwarf:** It’s an interesting looking rock. But we haven’t been able to figure out what else they like about it.

**Chunk:** So what’s your plan to get out, then?

**Dwarf:** We’re waiting for an opportunity to present itself. Maybe we uncover something we can use against them, or maybe they all get drunk and we ambush them. But unless we can get out with all the prisoners, we’re not leaving.

**Chunk:** Well, that’s no kind of plan. We’ll think of something. I like this "getting them drunk" idea. 

- From afar, Galadriel objects that we’ve established that they don’t party.
- The DM clarifies that "some of them get turnt."

One of the titan guards walks in as Chunk is having this furtive conversation, and the dwarf gives him a shove and a stern warning to be quiet.

# A risky dive

Galadriel and Tannin discuss their shaky plan to kill the titan scouts. 

**Tannin:** We need a way out onto the water. Then we lure them in there, the kraken eats them, you turn into a giant eagle, I ride on your back, and we fly away.

**Galadriel:** I dunno if I can pull off Polymorph here. Haven’t been getting the type of restorative rest I need.

**Tannin:** What about the Tiny Hut? Can we make that into a boat?

**Galadriel:** I… don’t think so. Can we make them think the tiberium is underwater? Like you’re a mer-dwarf, and that’s how we found it?

**Tannin:** They are gonna want me to go in.

- There is an uncomfortable silence; this is a very good point.

**Galadriel:** You could cast Fish Command on the kraken? Or some Feywild freshwater sharks? Or whatever Gilbert Finley was?

**Tannin:** I wish we could talk to Hanamir.

Galadriel tries to deceive the titans to say that the largest store of tiberium is in the river, and they’re not having it.

**Galadriel:** Yeah, we know it’s dangerous, but it’s down there! Enter at your own risk!

**Titan:** How’d you get it?

Tannin doesn’t deign to answer—he just dives in. As soon as he’s in there, he feels a hungry presence. There are things in the water that are freaky deaky. He has Darkvision and can see a pretty large fish, about six feet long. It’s swimming toward him. He uses his Trident of Fish Command to have this fish run interference for a little bit to guard him while he pretends to dig for tiberium. “PROTECT ME” is the simplest command. 

The titans, meanwhile, were shocked by Tannin just jumping in, so they’re waiting to see what happens. They definitely expect him to be eaten by the kraken.

Sure enough, the protector fish is grabbed by a tentacle. There’s lots of flailing, and then it’s gone. Tannin comes up to the surface and rolls onto the shore as soon as the tentacle rises up again. He pulls some tiberium from his loincloth.

**Tannin:** See? Tiberium. Just like she said. The bigger the risk, bigger the reward.

The giants are IMPRESSED. They think he’s crazy. They talk to themselves in Giant for a second, goading each other, but neither one wants to get closer to the water. 

**Titan:** Make the dwarf dive again. Bring more back.

**Galadriel:** He can only bring back a little bit at a time. We need our gear; we need safety. He risked his life just now to prove to you that I wasn’t lying, not to get more.

**Titan:** What gear?

**Galadriel:** We need you to release our friends if you want us to get our gear.

The titans consider this. Pushing our luck, we ask them to release all their slaves; they interpret this like “oh! Good idea! We’ll throw the slaves into the water to distract the kraken while we harvest the tiberium!"

They agree to walk back to the titan city with us, ostensibly to release our friends, and maybe to bring all the prisoners as bait.

- Yikes!!!

# Big Blue Moses

Chunk and Harlan are going to try to plan an insurrection among the enslaved dwarves. They're not sure how many titans they’d be up against—in total, so far, they've seen about 20 of them. There are a couple guards, and a couple titans also working in the mines. 

- Chunk won a jellybean jar contest one time, so by his estimation, there are between 200-600 giants in the mountain.
- But each giant would be a *ton* of work to kill. Their best bet is to incorporate some stealth in the prisonbreak, if they want anyone to escape alive.

The plan they land on is to get the dwarves down a long tunnel, then collapse one end of it and dig out to the surface. They start a whispering campaign amongst all the dwarves, and it spreads like wildfire. Soon, all of the prisoners are aware of the plan and look to Chunk and Harlan as their leaders.

- The nickname "Big Blue Moses" is used to refer to Chunk, even though no one knows who Moses is.

The emotions of the Feywild run hot, so when the time comes, the prisoners have a hard time being nonchalant.

# Dwarves' last stand

The battle begins with Harlan and Chunk teaming up to stage the cave-in. On the other side, there are three titans who begin hammering away at the rubble, fearing they're going to lose all their slaves. By the dwarves' estimate, it'll take twelve hours to dig out the other side to freedom, so the longer we can hold off the titans, the better. The initial cave-in buys us eight hours of digging time with the titans occupied with clearing it.

Meanwhile, Chunk starts firing up the most excitable dwarves. He plans to lead a charge of twenty of them once the titans break through.

- We realize that one of the three titans died in the initial cave-in, so there are only two remaining to fight. 
- Chunk casts a Lightning Bolt and Harlan casts Ice Storm at the titans.
- The first wave of dwarves does considerable damage to the titans, but they are all killed with a swing of a massive greatclub.

The battle rages between Chunk, Harlan, and the titans while the remaining dwarves dig out to the surface. Dwarves abandon the digging to help fight, slowing the progress and suffering major casualties. In the end, both the titans are killed, and only Chunk, Harlan, and a small band of dwarves remain.
