“Get the body!”

One of the bat riders lands and drags Harlan by his feet toward the group of orcs. Blood trickles between the cobblestones. 

“Hands off!” shrieks Hermione, and it’s unclear if the pun is intended. She sends three Magic Missiles straight into the orc’s neck. He doubles over, letting go of Harlan. 

[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) and Tannin dart forward. They pull Harlan to the threshold of the house into which Galadriel had fled. Hermione joins them, and there is a moment of reprieve as she shuts the door behind her.

Galadriel has crept up to a dark ceiling corner. She sounds like she might be hissing. With dawning disgust, Hermione realizes it’s just the continued noise of Galadriel’s skin sputtering and popping. After a minute or two, when the sound finally fades, Galadriel climbs down. The left half of her body is raw and dripping, like the sunken remains of a candle.

“Sorry, I’m disgusting,” she says. “But he needs this more than I do.” She kneels over Harlan and casts Healing Word on him. 

As the soft magical light passes from Galadriel’s hand to surround Harlan, the most gruesome aspects of his injuries start to fade. His wrist ends in an angry red scab, but he’s no longer losing blood, and the rest of his skin starts to bounce back from its drooping silly-putty quality. He opens his eyes effortfully. 

“Better,” says Galadriel. “But still not great.”

“You’re one to talk,” he croaks, pulling a face at her lopsided visage. “Thanks.” He closes his eyes again.

“That was rough, guys,” observes Tannin. “Pretty lucky I showed up, huh?” He notices Hermione and points at her. “Who’s this?”

“Hermione Daydark.” Hermione holds out her hand to Tannin, and he just sort of grunts at her in acknowledgement. “Elf wizard, leading scholar of magical creatures, and award-winning author of *Cursed Critters: A Practical Guide to Magical Pest Removal*, among other things.” She waits another moment, then drops her hand. “And you must be Tannin McBitters, the dwarven barbarian I’ve heard so much about.”

“Guilty,” smirks Tannin. 

“We’re grateful you came back when you did,” says Hanamir. “Where, exactly—”

But they are interrupted by a voice from outside. They recognize it as the gravelly contrabass of the orc leader.

“Let’s try this one more time, shall we?” 

Another Orcish voice begins reciting something that Hanamir guesses is a prayer to Shargaas. A sudden magical darkness descends on the adventurers inside the house; even with blindsight, Galadriel can’t see anything. 

“Prisoner exchange. We’ll give you this gnome you’re so interested in if you hand over our elf prisoner and leave the city right now.”

“Of course! That’s the deal we’ve been *trying* to make!” Hanamir replies. “Here she comes! Send in the gnome!” He makes some comically bad Foley artist footstep sounds.

“Are you really sending her over this time, or is it another magic trick?” comes a different, impatient orc voice.

“No tricks! Just a blue-haired lady, exiting the house right now!” Hanamir makes more dubious sound effects. “Still waiting on that gnome, though!”

“I’m losing patience,” says the voice of the orc leader. “What is it that you all even want here?”

“Oh, we’d like to prevent the unspeakable horror in this city from escaping and terrorizing the world,” Hanamir explains.

“I think you’re in over your head, half-orc,” says the orc leader, switching to Common. “We have business with the king of this city. We don’t want or care to fight you, really. We thought what you did to Cazna was hilarious.”

“Well, first of all, it *was* hilarious, so thank you,” Galadriel interjects. “But what kind of business do you all have with the king in the City of the Dead?” 

“We don’t have time to explain this to you. And it’s none of your concern. Just get out of here.”

“Hey, you’re the ones who have lost several soldiers in this fight and failed to kill any of us, despite your advantage in numbers. We should be the ones telling you to get out, and *we’ll* let you live,” points out Hermione.

The orc leader takes a moment to respond to this, and when he does, it sounds like Hermione struck a nerve.

“Here’s the deal. You all stumbled into this situation because the little half-orc delivery boy didn’t even know what he was carrying, and you wound up entangled with Cazna and the Lolth followers. But this is bigger than all of you.” He sounds like he’s spitting. “This is the business of Shargaas. And it is no business of yours.”

“You say you’re going to see the king, yes?” says Hanamir. “Why don’t we all go? Sort things out as a group, maybe?”

“You really won’t just leave? What is it that you want?” The orc leader sounds incredulous.

“You know, I’ve been curious about Shargaas for a long time, I gotta tell you,” says Hanamir. “I think there may be something in there for me. A way to connect to my culture. I’d love to hear about it all.”

The orc leader unleashes a string of wildly offensive curse words in Orcish.

“Fine. Come with us. But if any of you draws a weapon, you’re dead. And we’re leaving the gnome back here, guarded, so no funny business. Got it?”

“Great!” says Hanamir.

The adventurers walk alongside the orcs in an uneasy lockstep, neither group willing to walk ahead of the other. 

“So, brothers,” Hanamir chirps. “Tell me the good news about Shargaas!”

“You really don’t know?” says the orc mage, peering at Hanamir with some curiosity.

“I grew up around humans,” explains Hanamir. “At a university. Never met any orcs until later in life.”

“That does explain a lot,” says the mage. “I’ve never seen a half-orc before.”

“I have a lot of catching up to do,” says Hanamir. “Tell me everything.”

“Well, you’re in for a treat. Shargaas is cool. He won’t even hold it against you that you’re only half,” says the mage. “Don’t get me wrong, he’s completely evil, but he rewards anyone who makes offerings of stolen tribute in his honor.” 

“Fantastic,” says Hanamir.

“And you know about Gruumsh, right?” the mage continues. “Top of the pantheon, and been there a long time. And if you were to ask me, or any one of us, for that matter, it’s time for him to go. I follow Utris myself, but I’m allied with these Shargaasians in a common purpose.”

“You mean to overthrow Gruumsh, then?”

“Yes.” The mage says something salty and profane about Gruumsh in Orcish, prompting raucous cheers from the rest of the orcs. The rest of the walk through the sparkling, empty city devolves into chanting and roaring.

After some haphazard wandering, the unlikely companions arrive at an ornate building near the center of the city. A skeleton in a fancy robe, carrying a staff, greets them on the front steps.

“Welcome to the palace,” says the skeleton. The adventurers are surprised that this one can speak after their experience with the skeletons in the tavern. Its jaw doesn’t move, making the voice that emanates from the skull that much creepier. “What brings you here?”

“We are here for an audience with the king,” says the orc leader. “I am Khargol.”

“Hello, Khargol,” says the skeleton. “I am the king. I request kindly that you leave this city. We do not allow visitors.”

Khargol seems taken aback for a moment, but pushes ahead.

“I must insist,” says Khargol. “I have lost countless men in pursuit of a private audience with the king. It will be worth your while.”

“Very well,” says the skeleton. “Come with me to the throne room. Your companions can wait in the anteroom.”

They all follow the skeleton into the palace. The anteroom is high-ceilinged and made of the same pale, glossy marble as the exterior of the building. Khargol looks back at his men and nods once at them before continuing into the next room with the skeleton. 

Once he’s out of earshot, Hanamir turns to the mage.

“Say, just like how Gruumsh has been in charge for too long, it seems like maybe Khargol has been in charge for too long,” he says. “You’re the brains of the operation. Now’s your chance to really be the leader. What do you say?”

The mage stares blankly at Hanamir.

“I knew you weren’t really one of us,” he says. He motions to the war chief. “You should probably put this one in chains.”

“Anyone else have something to say?” says the war chief as he tightens a pair shackles around Hanamir’s wrists. 

“There’s no way we’re just gonna let them shackle him, right?” Tannin mutters to Galadriel. 

“It’s better than everyone dying,” Harlan says, speaking up for the first time in a long while. His voice sounds far away, like he still hasn’t caught up to them, and he’s back outside the tavern looking for his missing hand.

“I didn’t plane shift all the way back here to be rational,” says Tannin. He leaps forward and shoves the mage with his trident, knocking him to the ground. Following right behind him, Galadriel stabs him with her rapier. 

Hanamir then rests a foot on the fallen mage’s chest. The mage sputters.

“I can’t believe this,” he wheezes. “I thought we were really connecting, and then you double cross me.”

“What would Shargaas do, brother?” Hanamir rests more of his weight on the mage.

“F-fair—point—” gasps the mage. 

Tannin takes another swing with his trident, and the mage is toast. No—with the trident sticking out of his stomach like a fork, the mage is more like a well-done tray of brownies.

Hanamir, wrists still shackled, turns to the war chief next.

“You know, you’re the muscle of this operation. I think it’s time you were in charge. What do you say?”

The war chief looks like he’s not in the mood to be murdered today.

“You know what? No,” says the war chief. “I’m out. Bye.” And he runs straight out the front door of the palace and doesn’t stop.

Meanwhile, one of the bat riders, who has been circling above them and looping around the buttresses, drops a few darts on Harlan. 

“He has been through enough today!” Hermione scolds the bat rider. She shoots Magic Missiles back at him. “Can’t you follow your friend’s example and get out of here? Fly away!”

As if expressly to contradict her, the bat rider lands on the marble floor across from Hermione and starts to dismount. What he doesn’t see is the one-handed cleric approaching him from the side. He is taken by surprise when that cleric uses his one remaining hand to grab the back of his shirt and swing himself onto the bat, motorcycle passenger style. The bat flaps its wings in distress and, haltingly, Harlan and the bat rider lift off into the air, nearly scraping the ceiling of the anteroom. Harlan is clinging to the bat rider like a sailor to a mast on stormy seas. 

Hermione watches them take off in total awe. 

“Yes!!! Steal his bat!” she cheers.

Galadriel climbs up a wall to get closer to the bat rider. She shoots an arrow at him and sinks it, secretly impressed with herself for not accidentally hitting Harlan. 

Hanamir rushes outside to see if the war chief is really gone—he is. He spots the second bat rider patrolling the airspace above the palace and shouts up at him.

“Hey! You’re the flyingest of all these guys! Maybe you should be in charge!”

The bat rider ignores him. 

Back inside the anteroom, the first bat rider is struggling to rid himself of Harlan. 

“You’re going down,” Hermione says to herself. She casts Magic Missile one last time, and her aim is true. The bat rider is knocked off his steed, falling at least thirty feet to the cold marble floor. He’s alive, but he lands on his neck in such a way that Hermione has the immediate sense that he will never walk again. 

Harlan steadies himself on the bat’s back and gains control, flying in wide circles around the room. He is grinning.

“YAAAAS HARLAN!” cries Galadriel from the ceiling, surprised and delighted.

At that moment, Khargol emerges from the throne room. He takes in the chaos of the scene in the anteroom for a moment, then shakes his head as if dismissing it.

“We’re getting out of here,” he shouts. 

He starts to run toward the door, and the adventurers notice that he is limping heavily. A smeared trail of blood follows his uneven footsteps on the glowing white marble. He shouts at the bat rider with the broken neck as he passes.

“It was a trap! I said let’s go!”
