[Chunk](/characters/chunk/) watches the black and white clown’s expression turn from concerned to alarmed as he sees the red and blue clown leave the ballroom with [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) and [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/). 

“I gotta go,” the black and white clown says. 

He pushes past Chunk and almost collides with an elderly elf man who inspects a painting with a giant pair of opera glasses. 

“My word!” says the elf, steadying himself on Chunk’s arm. “Thank you, young man.”

“No problem, sir,” says Chunk. He tries to politely pull away and pursue the black and white clown, but it’s not happening.

“People these days can be so discourteous!” the elf grumbles. “Whatever happened to decency in the art world?”

“I don’t know, sir,” says Chunk. He sees the black and white clown reach the glass doorway to the garden. Tannin meets him there and blocks his way, arms crossed, smirking.

“Looking for someone?” asks Tannin. 

“Yeah,” says the black and white clown, craning his neck left and right. “A companion of mine. Could you move?”

“‘Fraid not,” says Tannin. He digs in his heels.

“Get out of the way,” says the black and white clown. He’s several heads and shoulders taller than Tannin, but seems to find Tannin’s obstinacy off-putting, and doesn’t make a physical challenge yet.

“Nah,” says Tannin.

Then there’s an odd moment. Tannin feels like somehow the contents of his brain are being picked up, fondled, and tossed aside. He recoils, stumbling backward through the doorway and into the garden. The black and white clown’s face loses its sense of urgency. 

“You know what?” says the clown. “I’m sure it’ll be fine.”

“What was that?!” Tannin shouts, feeling a rage brewing. He looks around. Galadriel and the red and blue clown are gone; only the night-blooming jasmine and primroses remain.  “What did you just do? And—where’s the other clown? He was here a minute ago, talking to my friend—”

Now looking down at Tannin with pity, the black and white clown laughs a little. 

“Really, don’t worry about it,” he says. “There’s nothing you can—”

He is cut off by a blur from the shadows. As if materializing from nothing, [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) strikes, hitting the clown so hard in the back of the head with the hilt of his enchanted short sword that he falls to the ground, conscious but motionless, completely stunned.

“Galadriel and the clown known as Number Six are gone,” says Hanamir quickly. “I believe they plane-shifted. We need to figure out a plan, and fast.”

Back in the ballroom, [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) has pulled [Goldpeak](/characters/goldpeak/) aside.

“Yes?” says Goldpeak, looking faintly exasperated. “I saw the half-elf go off with one of the clowns. Am I released from involvement now?”

“Maybe,” says Harlan. “I had a question about one of the guests. Lady Platernia?”

“Lady who?” says Goldpeak. 

Harlan scans the crowd and points her out. She’s smiling the same broad, glittering smile at a different gentleman now, a burly dwarf dressed like an old-timey strongman. 

“What the—?!” Goldpeak stammers. “She is *not* a guest!”

“Who is she?” says Harlan.

“A known thief!” says Goldpeak. “A—a notorious *con woman* who crashes events like this with *unfortunate* regularity!”

“Whoa,” says Harlan. “So she’s stolen from you before?”

“Yes! I can’t believe she’s trying it again!” A vein bulges in Goldpeak’s red-tinged forehead. “Please—I arranged this entire gala for you. Please, please get her out of here.”

“Okay,” says Harlan. “Okay. Yes. I just need to check on my friends and make sure all is going well with the clown first.”

“Please. I don’t care what you have to do, just get her out—”

“Understood,” says Harlan, backing away toward the garden door.

“Where are we?” asks Galadriel. 

Up close, the clown’s red and blue face paint is flaky. It settles in the lines on his forehead, which deepen as he tucks the tuning fork back into an inner pocket of his robe.

“Far away,” says the clown.

Galadriel feels another tide of nausea tug at her innards. Gravity feels wrong, somehow. She looks down from the balcony, but is it really down? Is she standing sideways? The tower is on a slope—that much is clear to her. If she looks one way, down at the receding mountainside, she sees an army of creatures with metallic exoskeletons, each bearing a trident in one of their several multi-jointed arms. If she turns the other way, to look up—or what would be “up” if not for the feeling that she might fall that way if she’s not careful—she sees the steep hillside terminate in a smoking volcanic crater. 

“This is what awaits,” the clown continues. “This is what you’re up against.”

She takes another look at the army. There’s more than just the beetle-like creatures, she notices. There are others, taller, like spinning mantises, and large green horned ogres, and a few more monsters at the edges of her periphery that she doesn’t have the words to describe. She summons a reckless courage from what feels like her very last reserves.

“Looks like quite the infestation,” she says. She slowly folds her arms in front of her chest, keeping the gauntleted wrist conspicuously in front. “Spiders are good for taking care of unwanted insects, you know.”

The clown stares at her for a moment that feels too long. Then he cracks a smile and shakes his head. 

“You know,” he says, “maybe there’s a deal that we could make here.”

Galadriel swallows.

“I’m listening.”

“We don’t have a particular qualm with you, or the band of fools you travel with,” says the clown. “Now that you’ve seen what’s coming, perhaps you’ll convince them to step aside, and get us to [Slee](/characters/slee/).”

“Question,” says Galadriel. “Who’s ‘us’? And why do you want to ‘get to Slee’? I just want to clarify that once and for all.”

The clown’s smile twists.

“I think you know that the Anti-Magic League has certain goals,” he says. “And at this point in time, we view King Slee as standing in the way of those goals.”

“So, using a tuning fork to shift yourself to another plane, that’s not counter to the AML’s mission statement? Again, just clarifying.”

“Sometimes we make alliances that serve a greater good,” says the clown. He stares down at Galadriel’s gauntlet. “I’m sure you can understand that.”

“Fair. But I don’t see what’s in it for me if my friends and I decide to help you get access to the king,” says Galadriel.

“Oh,” says the clown, “you’ll probably live.”

It may be her imagination, but Galadriel feels another disorienting shift in the gravity of this plane. In the room adjoining the balcony, two of the armored bug creatures appear, bearing a set of shackles.

“I’ll let you think about it for a little while,” says the clown. “You can get us to King Slee, or you can stay here until we decide if you’ll be useful in some other way.”

The creatures slap the shackles onto her wrists and march her down a narrow staircase that seems to go on and on in a dizzy spiral for hundreds of feet, until finally, mercifully, ending in a darkened stone dungeon. She clings to the filthy floor of the cell, still feeling like she’s spinning through space.

Tannin rushes toward the stunned black and white clown, fists raised, but Hanamir holds up a hand.

“No,” says Hanamir. “Get the Dimensional Shackles. He’s more powerful than he seems.”

Tannin summons the Dimensional Shackles from the Bag of Holding. As he restrains the clown, a thought comes into his head that feels foreign: *Let him go.*

He takes a step backward again, recognizing the feeling of violation from the clown’s earlier trespass into his consciousness. The black and white clown, finally recovering from the blow to his skull, gives him a look that says, “well, I had to try it, didn’t I?”, and then raises his shackled arms over his head toward the sky.

In what almost looks like a freak accident, a thick bolt of lightning connects the cloudless night air to the ground, using Hanamir as a conductor. 

For a breath-stopping moment, Tannin thinks the hardy and dextrous half-orc strategist might be dead in one hit. But Hanamir sits back up, dazed and smoking, just as Harlan and Chunk appear in the doorway to the garden.

“Magical weapons only on this one, fellas,” says Hanamir, woozily. 

Chunk lets loose a bolt of lightning of his own—not as powerful, but murderously precise—that takes the clown by surprise, giving Tannin an opening for a hit with his trident. 

Gala guests begin to crowd the doorway behind Harlan, murmuring, some shrieking with alarm at the sudden thunderous noise. He casts Fog Cloud over the garden. The silhouettes of Chunk and Tannin doing their worst to the shackled clown are almost fully obscured.

“Just a localized storm,” Harlan calls back to the ballroom. “For your safety, please, everyone stay back. I’m a Cleric of [Kord](/characters/kord/); I can handle this.”

He shuts the glass doorway behind him and enters the fog. 

“Grab him!” he yells to Chunk. “Bag of Holding!”

Tannin holds the bag open. The black and white clown begins muttering something quietly in a language none of them understands. 

“Not… a… chance,” winces Hanamir. He rises unsteadily to his feet and smacks the clown across the face with the flat of his blade. The clown falls silent as his entire body is stuffed into the extradimensional space. Tannin heaves the bag over his shoulder in triumph.

“Run!” says Harlan. “Now!”

Party guests’ faces are pressed against the door to the garden. A few muffled exclamations can be heard through the glass panes. 

“Where to?” asks Chunk.

“Anywhere,” says Harlan. He lends Hanamir his shoulder and helps him limp through the mist, past trimmed hedges and a softly bubbling koi pond. A fence in the distance abuts a wide green field, and the dark shape of a barn is just visible in the moonlight beyond it. “To the stables!”
