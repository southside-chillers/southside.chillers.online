After describing his brief vision of a troglodyte, [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) pockets the mysterious verdant orb, and the party continues on through the tower of Lolth.

[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) leads them down the next corridor. It is lined with five flaming torches and one unlit torch. A staircase at the end of the hallway is dripping with blood. Though Harlan and [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) inspect the torches and the staircase for any signs of magical tampering, they find nothing, and continue onward. What’s a little blood in a spider tower? C’mon!

They proceed up the stairs to another torchlit hallway, but this time, there’s a door at the end, and they can hear voices echoing behind it. It’s a calm discussion in what sounds like Common. Harlan opens the door—sneakily—and the party sees two goblins standing next to a treasure chest. 

“You been to Chez Goblin? Back in Goblintown? Best buffalo chicken totchos in my entire life,” one says. He’s dressed in heavy dwarven armor, clearly not made for him, and carries an enormous golden axe.

“No way, really?” says the other. This one is dressed like a typical goblin and carries a short sword.

“Yeah way. You really gotta go sometime.” 

Our heroes bicker amongst themselves about what to do for several minutes. Finally, Hanamir throws a dart and hits the normal-looking goblin in the neck. 

“Ow!” says Dart Neck, and confers briefly with his friend in Goblin. Then he shrugs. Heavy Armor reaches for his axe.

“Stop right there,” says [Tannin](/characters/tannin/).

“Or what?” says Heavy Armor. 

Tannin indicates his javelin, and Heavy Armor chuckles.

“Are you sure about that? Don’t you recognize this axe?” 

“Nope!” Harlan butts in. “Should we recognize it?”

The goblin approaches and shows them the inscription on the golden axe: it belongs to Abathor, the dwarven god of greed. 

“Ohhhh, Abathor! Much respect for Abathor,” says Harlan, trying to whip up a rapport. “Sorry about that dart. Our friend isn’t quite himself. Now, who are you fine gentlemen? What brings you to this Lolth tower today?"

“We’re adventurers,” says Dart Neck. He plucks the dart out of his gristly nape and regains some dignity. “We procure fine and interesting things and connect them to discerning buyers throughout the Forgotten Realms. [Sanford](/characters/sanford/) & Son. I’m Sanford. He’s my son."

Harlan’s interest is piqued; the bargaining begins posthaste. The goblins’ inventory includes a set of playing cards, a robe, a blue hat, a clear orb, some shackles, various potions, a silver breastplate, and a ring. 

“This ring? Grants protection to the wearer. 350 gold pieces. Can’t hurt,” says Sanford. He points to the playing cards. “Or perhaps for any magically-inclined among you, a Deck of Illusions—nearly complete, very rare, 500 gold.”

“What about those shackles?” says Harlan.

“Dimensional Shackles,” says the Son. “Keeps a plane-shifting creature stuck in one plane.”

“How much?” says Harlan.

“Got anything you might want to sell to us for it?"

In an odd, disorienting moment, Tannin, Hanamir, and Galadriel find themselves persuaded to leave Harlan alone with the goblins. They return after a short while to learn that Harlan has sold a “private heirloom” to the goblins for enough gold to purchase the Dimensional Shackles. Harlan doesn’t elaborate on what went down, and the rest of the party is just like, “okay."

“Nice doing business with you,” says Harlan. “Where are you headed?”

“Town of the Undead next,” says Sanford. “But before we go… any chance you’d want to sell us that pretty jade orb? Or that gauntlet? Because if it’s enchanted or cursed, we’re very, very interested. You might have seen our billboards along the forest path? WE BUY CURSED GOODS?"

“Sorry,” says Galadriel. “I quite literally cannot remove it from my body.” Harlan also politely declines to part with the troglodyte orb, even though they say they’d pay ten platinum pieces for it.

“All right, then,” says Sanford. “But if you change your mind, or find any other orbs you might want to sell for a good price, you can find us using this.” He gives Harlan a plain-looking ring, and then the two goblins pick up their treasure chest and head out.

The party continues up the stairs to a large cavernous room. There’s blood on the floor—some of it fresh, some of it old, some of it green. There are two large metal doors on opposite walls. The floor slopes upward in a staggered fashion, sort of like amphitheatre seating. At the end of the room, there’s another staircase up to the next floor. In one corner, there is a pile of rags and six levers in the wall, all different colors: white, black, gold, green, blue, and red. The gold one is pulled down.

_CRASH!_ From another plane, a Death Slaad appears, roaring and bleeding from a freshly-chopped-off arm. There is someone riding on its back—it’s [the Savage](/characters/the-savage/)! And he’s impaled on a spike on the Slaad’s back! Tannin throws his spear at the Slaad, but misses and knocks the Savage to the ground instead. 

“Stand back!” shouts the Savage. Hanamir throws a dart, but it bounces off the Slaad’s hide.

In each of their minds, they hear a voice saying: `GIVE UP NOW AND I’LL SPARE YOU AFTER I EAT THIS ONE.`

The Slaad then shoots four fireballs at the Savage, but somehow misses. The Savage swings his sword back and also misses. The Slaad chuckles and then casually bites off the Savage’s hand with the sword still clutched in its grasp. 

Galadriel casts Detect Thoughts on the Slaad. It is thinking about how it is going to kill this guy and then kill everyone else, despite its earlier psychic reassurance. She also learns it has been imprisoned a long time, and is now freed, with one mission only: to kill. And it has a gem in its brain that, if captured, would put the Slaad under the capturer’s control.

Harlan tries flipping the gold lever back upright, but it doesn’t stay put—once triggered, it’s broken, it seems. Harlan then casts a fog cloud that envelops the Slaad and the Savage in the middle of the room. 

Tannin pulls down the white lever. One of the metal doors opens. From that room, a Wyrmling appears—a baby red dragon, perhaps 15 years old. “Dang!” Tannin, having not learned his lesson, then pulls the green lever. An ominous gear clicking sound starts coming from the ceiling. 

The Savage does something in the fog cloud with the Death Slaad, but no one can see what he does. 

The Wyrmling stretches its heavy wings and approaches Hanamir. It snaps its neck forward to bite him, but just misses. Boldly, Hanamir darts forth and takes a quick stab at the Wyrmling with his short sword, nicking its hide. 

Galadriel starts Viciously Mocking the dragon, but it has no effect. She then pulls the red lever impulsively and the lights come on.

Abruptly, the clicking noise stops, and ten arrows shoot down from the ceiling. The Slaad and Harlan are each struck with two arrows, but everyone else is spared. 

“Welp, guess I’m doing this,” says Harlan. He pulls the blue lever… and the floor in the center of the room drops away. For an eerie moment, the Wyrmling and Hanamir float above the darkness before falling down to a watery pit below.
