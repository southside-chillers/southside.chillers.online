“Welcome back,” says [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/). “It is now time for us to tell the tale of what happened in the final hours before the Moon Festival. The culmination of all that our humble questing party has worked for, thus far. The showdown that would become legendary amongst the gods.”

---

She conjures a new flashback window. In it, you can see [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/), [Harlan](/characters/harlan/), and Galadriel standing in the Prayer Room, discussing their course of action. You see Hanamir take the pink pearl orb and approach the statue of the orc god, Gruumsh. He falls into a trance. Harlan and Galadriel stand in the center of the room and peer at him cautiously. After a few moments, Hanamir places the pink pearl orb in the statue, and it evaporates. He returns to his companions and presents a book.

“Gruumsh gave me this,” he says, pleased as punch. 

“Was he nice? Was he dreamy?” asks Harlan.

“Yes. Very strong looking. I felt safe.” Hanamir flips through the book’s pages.

“And books are your favorite! An unlikely gift from an orc god,” says Galadriel. 

“Yes. He doesn’t quite understand, but he knows I am particular about my books,” says Hanamir. “I told him Shargaas is attacking the moon. He didn’t know, and he was displeased. I asked him what we can do to help. His advice was to kill the priestess, [Cazna](/characters/cazna/), and not to trust Tiamat.”

“The dragon god?” says Harlan. “That’s not one of our orbs.”

“What does the book say?” says Galadriel.

“It’s all about planes,” Hanamir says, skimming pages. The book is called The Big Book of Planes. “Some places exist between planes. ‘Have fun,’ it says.”

“So what now?” says Harlan. “Another orb, another god, hopefully another piece of information?”

“I don’t know that we have any other options,” says Galadriel.

Harlan takes the fire giant orb to its corresponding statue and returns with nothing in his hands.

“I didn’t get a material gift this time, but I did get some information,” he says. “This fire giant god—very intimidating guy—really hates Lolth. He is very much rooting for us and against her. He says that Cazna is protected by a barrier that is impenetrable by force or magic. It will hold as long as she concentrates on her spell. So he advised us not to waste our energy trying to break down the barrier.” He pauses. “I also asked him how to get to the top of the tower. He said we’d need to speak to Tiamat about that.”

“But—” starts Galadriel, eyes wide.

“I know. Who do we trust on the topic of the evil dragon god? The evil orc god or the evil fire giant god?” muses Harlan.

“Hard to say,” says Hanamir, though he seems unfocused on the conversation, as he’s still skimming his book on planes.

“If we were to try and speak to Tiamat,” says Harlan, “how might we do that? Through the divot in the center of the room? And without an orb, what would we offer up to him?” 

His eyes drift toward Galadriel’s backpack, where Buddy’s face can be seen peeking out of the top. The pig snorts contentedly. 

“Watch it,” snaps Galadriel. “Don’t you have a god of your own you could ask for wisdom?”

“That’s true,” says Harlan. “Worth a try, anyway.”

Harlan kneels and begins to pray. Hanamir and Galadriel aren’t sure if it’s their imagination, or if they are hearing distant claps of thunder from beyond the tower walls. A faint mist rises around Harlan, condensing into a cloud above all of them that flickers with electricity.

“Didn’t we just talk?” comes a voice from within the cloud. It sounds like heavy rainfall and roaring wind.

“O Stormy Father,” says Harlan, head bowed, “I thank you. I do not take your time and wisdom for granted. I have been following your instructions, and I find myself stymied at this juncture. I beseech you to bless us with any wisdom you might possess regarding our path forward.”

Thunder rattles the entire room. Galadriel and Hanamir share a nervous look.

“I sense many trapped souls where you are,” says the Voice of Kord. “Souls of evil beings.”

“Yes, we found them encased in gemstone orbs, littered throughout this tower,” says Harlan.

“And what have you been doing with them?” booms Kord.

“Well, we thought that, uh, perhaps…”

“Remember, I am your god,” says Kord.

“We’ve, uh, we’ve returned a few of them…” 

“...To their evil owners.”

“In furtherance of our quest! To save the Moon!” Harlan bows even deeper.

“Hm,” snorts Kord, with a crackle of lightning. “I’m not really a Moon guy.”

“Well, hey, the Moon has an impact on the tides, affecting the weather…”

“I have an impact on the tides and the weather!” roars Kord. 

“Absolutely, your Holiness, I just thought maybe you got a bit of an assist from the Moon—”

“I don’t need a Moon assist! I’m the God of Storms!” The tower itself seems to vibrate in another roll of thunder.

“Of course, my lord. Of course. I humbly ask your forgiveness. And if I am misinterpreting any of your guidance, I would like to be corrected. I only pray that you give us direction toward the successful completion of our quest. The Moon is in peril, and its absence would affect all who inhabit this land.”

There is a long silence, punctuated only with flickers of light from within the cloud.

“My advice? These orbs you possess are worth a great deal of human gold. Go sell them and be prosperous. Do not give them back to evil gods.”

“Understood. Understood,” says Harlan. “And how might we reach the top of the tower? And kill Cazna?”

“I know nothing of that.”

“Anything about Tiamat?” Harlan tries.

“Tiamat? The god of the chromatic dragons?”

“That’s the one,” says Harlan. “We were told to seek help from him.”

“Who told you to seek the aid of Tiamat?!” Kord’s voice smacks into them all like a freezing ocean wave. “What kind of sadistic joke were they playing on you?”

“One of the other gods here,” says Harlan.

“An evil god.”

“We’ve had conflicting reports from multiple evil gods, sir,” Harlan mutters.

“Well, listen to your god now. If there is a follower of Tiamat here, do not give their soul back to Tiamat. Do not do that.”

“Understood, my lord,” says Harlan. “And what about this divot in the floor here? Is there a god here crying out for souls?”

“What divot?” asks Kord.

A great hissing sound erupts from the cloud, and it disappears into a trail of vapor. Before their eyes, the party sees that there is no longer an indentation in the center of the room. In its place, there is a statue of a five-headed dragon. It is Tiamat. 

“Thank you, my lord!”

“Hmph. I wish you had more parents I could kill,” the voice of Kord echoes near the ceiling. “I thought it would teach you not to rely on others.”

“I, uh, wish that too, your holiness,” says Harlan. 

“Thanks for groveling. I have some things I gotta go doooo...” Kord’s absence is immediate and smells like tall grass after the rain.

Letting a solemn silence pass, Galadriel approaches the statue of Tiamat and senses its arcane power. 

“It wants a soul very badly,” she murmurs. “Any soul will do.”

“Well, I hate to sound callous,” says Harlan, dusting himself off as he stands, “but if we don’t want to give it an orb, and none of us want to be sacrificed…” 

“Yes?” prompts Hanamir, genuinely not following.

“Well…” says Harlan, glancing again at Buddy in Galadriel’s backpack.

“Oh, are you suggesting we murder my best friend again?” she snarls.

“I would never!” Harlan feigns shock. “But since you brought it up…”

“Would a pig have a soul that would satisfy a dragon god?” Hanamir wonders. 

“As a cleric, I—”

“If it comes down to it, Harlan, I will fight you.” Galadriel clenches her fists and stares him down. 

“I was going to say, as a cleric, I can check to see if pigs even have souls.”

He holds out a hand over Buddy’s sweet noggin. Upon grazing the baby-soft peachfuzz atop Buddy’s precious noodle, Harlan suddenly understands the eternal struggle of what it is to be a pig; he has seen all of the porcine condition in its infinite shades of meaning. He jumps back, utterly repulsed by the idea of sacrificing this creature. 

“Pigs really super do have souls,” he concludes, a bit shaken.

“Damn right,” says Galadriel.

“So what now?” says Hanamir. They stare at each other.

“I… could talk to Lolth,” Galadriel says, finally, holding out her gauntleted wrist like a foreign object. They all look at it in silence.

Without further discussion, Galadriel kneels to the ground and addresses the spider goddess. 

“Lolth,” she says. “Mother. Speak to me.”

The light in the room dims. A shadow, darker than a moonless night, descends as if on a silk string from the ceiling and settles in the air above Galadriel’s head. Galadriel’s eyes fill with black smoke, and then the shadow sinks down to swallow her completely.

“If she comes back possessed,” says Harlan, “what’s our plan?”

“I think I have an idea,” says Hanamir.

It doesn’t take long. The shadow lifts with a softly clicking sigh.

“I spoke to her,” says Galadriel. “And she can show me how to get to the top of the tower.”

“Hey, Gals,” says Hanamir, affecting a casual air, “while you were praying, we thought we might just give up and go home.”

“Yeah,” says Harlan, catching on. “We thought we could go back to Eillin and actually burn it down instead? And maybe make some bacon out of the pig?”

“What?!” she gasps. “Oh—I see. No, I would still rather not do any of those things.”

Hanamir holds eye contact with her for a long moment, then assures Harlan, “It’s true.”

“I told Lolth that I killed her followers,” says Galadriel. “I told her I did it to prove that I alone am worthy of being her high priestess. I asked her how to unseat Cazna.” 

“And?” says Harlan.

“She asked me if I think I am truly worthy. And she asked me why I had not bound myself to my holy relic.” She gulps. “I told her I was waiting to do it in her presence. And so now I… I’m bound to her. I can never take the gauntlet off.”

Galadriel’s eyes fill with black smoke again, and a terrible voice comes from her mouth.

“Do you want to come to the top of the tower now?”

Galadriel’s eyes clear and a door appears in the wall in front of them. Before they proceed, she casts invisibility on Hanamir. He leads them through the door and up the stairs in unseen silence.

They emerge on the roof. The moon shines weakly overhead, as if struggling; much of its light is dampened by a malevolent shadow. Its voice, distant but beautiful, addresses Galadriel:

“Are you a follower of my accursed mother?”

“Y-yes,” says Galadriel. 

“Then I have nothing to say to you. For accepting the help of Lolth, you are doomed.” 

Tears spring into Galadriel’s eyes.

“But is there anything I—”

“I have nothing to say.” The shadow seems to gain ground over the moon’s waning light. At the opposite end of the rooftop, behind a shimmering web, they see Cazna, who seems not to have noticed them.

“Remember, we learned she’s protected by a barrier,” says Harlan. “Probably the web.”

“Do you think it extends around the other side?” says Hanamir.

“Galadriel, perhaps you could check?” suggests Harlan. “You can climb along the side of the tower. Leave Buddy here if you want.”

“He’s staying in my backpack, thank you,” says Galadriel, wiping away tears. “I will never trust you with him in a million years.” She climbs down over the side of the tower, trying to remain calm, but trembling with grief. Buddy nuzzles the back of her neck and oinks reassuringly. 

The side of the tower is smooth and cold. She creeps along the side until she is at the edge beneath Cazna. The priestess remains deeply entranced in her ritual… and there is no web on this side.

Galadriel climbs closer. She lifts herself up to stand on the roof behind Cazna. Through the web, she can see Harlan rush forward, trying to create a distraction. Cazna looks up and notices him, and with a flick of her wrist, she conjures a phase spider and sets it upon him. She is still engrossed in her spell. 

Galadriel breathes as quietly as she can and tiptoes even closer. The priestess smells like incense and witch hazel. She sees the phase spider lunge at Harlan and miss. The time to do it—if she’s going to do it—is now.

She draws her short sword and, without hesitating further, plunges it into Cazna’s back. 

“I’m the high priestess now, biiitch!” cries Galadriel.

Cazna howls in pain and the magical web around her evaporates like steam into the night sky. Harlan’s hammer is already raised; he dodges another attack from the phase spider, runs through the disintegrating barrier, and slams Cazna with it, knocking her to the ground. 

Hanamir, still invisible, swings for the phase spider and makes a dent in its prickly blue hide. Shrieking in confusion, it advances on the foe it can see. It sinks its teeth into Harlan’s side and rips a mortal-looking chunk of flesh right out of him. Meanwhile, Cazna picks herself up, wounded and enraged.

Galadriel gathers up all the magic she can muster and casts Healing Word on Harlan. His arteries stop gushing quite so terminally onto the rooftop. He reaches for the satchel the hunger god gave him and, in desperation, takes a bite of bread. Immediately—and a little eerily—he is restored to perfect health.

Galadriel then whips back around and casts Tasha’s Hideous Laughter on Cazna. The priestess is overcome with giggles, then full-bellied laughter, then hysterics, and falls to her knees.

“You see, Lolth?” Galadriel cries. “She is weak! She is not worthy of your favor! She is not fit to wipe the crust from your multitudinous eyes!”

Harlan feels Hanamir’s invisible arms lifting him back to his feet. “Use the storm,” he whispers. “Now’s your shot.”

“On it,” says Harlan. He summons a gust of wind and blasts it straight at Cazna. 

Convulsing, she flies backward off the roof. 

Everyone, even the phase spider, rushes to the edge. The priestess, screaming not with fear but with amusement, falls. And then the laughter stops.

“Is she…” says Harlan.

“Yes,” says Hanamir. “Dead. Completely. Exactly.”

The moon emerges, full and bright and unnaturally large. The phase spider blinks out of existence. 

A plume of smoke from the ground rises up to the edge of the roof. It is in the shape of Cazna’s body, but its edges are blurred, and moonlight shines through it, so bright that the adventurers shield their eyes. The shadow Cazna does not laugh.

The tower goes hazy; things that were once solid might not be. A black curtain sweeps to one side out of the nothingness, and an arachnid, all enormous legs and glittering obsidian eyes, appears. It picks up Cazna’s lifeless body. Suddenly the arachnid is a drow, Lolth in her humanoid form, twelve feet tall and even more terrifying to behold. She cradles Cazna like a child and kisses her face, and then, with a snap of her jaw, bites off the priestess’s legs.

Cazna’s severed torso falls to the ground. Lolth grabs the corpse’s hand and drags her back through the black curtain. The black curtain disappears.

The party exhales. They have no words for their disbelief. They are standing alone at the top of the tower. Before them, they see three other curtains billowing gently, though there is no breeze.

Commercial break. An aerial shot of the town of Eillin. Then the camera pans down main street to stop and focus on the famous tavern in the town square. A man with coins for eyes opens the door. The audio is muffled and polluted with background noise.

“Welcome to Fleck’s! I’m Fleck, and the locals know Fleck’s is the best spot in town to get your pre-game on before the Moon Festival this weekend.” He waves an arm. “Follow me!”

A star wipe introduces a new shot of the tavern interior. It is mostly empty, but H’Jun is passed out face down on the bar. Fleck is behind the bar cleaning tankards with a questionable-looking rag.

V.O. (Fleck): “Meet the regulars. Stop and say hi. I may not be able to see you, but I sure can serve you the finest ale in Eillin!”

A diagonal wipe to a shot of a stock room full of kegs. Frunk Thunderstruck wanders into the shot, fiddling with his ring, then jumps out of the way when he notices the camera.

V.O. (Fleck): “Fleck’s Tavern. Eillin’s hottest bar, restaurant, inn, and part-time club. Open 24 hours the weekend of the Moon Festival. Moon-themed drink specials and half off totchos all weekend.”
