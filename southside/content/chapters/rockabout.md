As a young elf, [Hermione](/characters/hermione/) suffered frequently from nightmares. It’s not that she was afraid of the *dark*, she would always explain. She was afraid of what might be *hiding* in the dark. It’s part of how she became interested in thaumazoology, in fact. 

“To study a creature is to tame it in your mind,” she would sometimes say when introducing herself at cocktail parties.  “If you know its needs, its weaknesses, its habitual behavior… you can outsmart it. You can protect yourself with knowledge.”

Tonight, during the group’s long rest on the road to Aberith, Hermione suffers from nightmares for the first time in years. But they’re nothing like the nightmares she used to have. 

It’s the same dream over and over: her friend—it’s not clear which friend—has a child, a young boy no older than four. He is dying, and there’s nothing anyone can do. The most talented healers in the world have all failed to cure his illness. Hermione is overwhelmed with grief, and would do anything to save him, but all she can do is watch on helplessly as he dies. 

The boy dies this way countless times in Hermione’s head before she wakes up. The darkness around her is still deep. There are hours to go until sunrise, but she can’t just lie there with that dream rattling around in her head. She packs her things quietly, leaves a short note, and walks onward alone.

The other adventurers awaken abruptly to the sound of [Tannin](/characters/tannin/)’s voice reading in a loud monotone.

“My dear friends,” he announces. “Due to some distressing dreams I have decided to travel ahead on my own worry not though I will meet you at the gates of Aberith much love—” He squints. “Herm—Hermy… nine. Ohhh, is that the blue-haired chick?” He counts the other members of the party, who are grumbling incoherently. “Yeah, must be.”

“We did introduce you,” says [Harlan](/characters/harlan/). “Days ago.”

“Forgot,” shrugs Tannin. He drops the note on the ground. “Come on, guys, the sun’s almost done rising. Let’s go.”

[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/), [Redyl](/characters/redyl/), and [the Savage](/characters/the-savage/) find this call-to-action persuasive. Harlan seems to be considering it. [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) dissents.

After a few minutes, though, even she cannot remain asleep amidst the high-pitched shrieking noises produced by Harlan’s bat.

“Whoa, whoa, whoa,” Harlan says, holding out his single hand for the bat to sniff. “It’s me, remember?”

The bat considers this, sniffing, and then shrieks again.

“Have you thought about giving it a name?” asks Hanamir.

“It’s a him, I think,” says Harlan. “And yes. I was thinking Camazotz, for the god of bats. Zotz for short. That all right with you, Zotz?”

Zotz emits another noise, still piercing, still horrible, but somehow reminiscent of a purr.

“I’ll take it,” says Harlan.

As the morning lengthens, the scent of marshland grows stronger in the air. There’s still low tree coverage along their path, and a thick underbrush that seems alive with unseen fauna.

“Don’t react,” Hanamir murmurs to the party, “but I think there are two large creatures off to our right that may be stalking us.” He makes eye contact with each of them, then nods to the Savage. “Take the gnome and stay clear, will you?”

“Fine,” says the Savage. He scoops Redyl up by his armpits and places him on his own shoulders. It’s very cute, and the Savage scowls, knowing it.

Hanamir tiptoes into the dense thicket to the right of the path. In a matter of seconds, the adventurers hear the bass-clef version of an angry owl’s hoot. Hanamir reappears among the party like a snake retreating to its den after a successful bite. 

“Owlbears,” he reports. “Two of them. One smaller, one larger. I stabbed the smaller. Ah, here they are.” 

As described, the two giant feathery beasts burst from the brush with talons curled. The smaller of the two is bleeding. Galadriel casts Thunderclap on them both, knocking them back before their claws can find a target. 

Harlan squeezes his heels into Zotz’s side and the bat takes flight over the impending battle. From the air, he casts Sacred Flame on the smaller owl. It hits the ground again, and this time struggles to get back up. Galadriel shoots a well-timed arrow, and it collapses for good.

As if retaliating, the larger owlbear lashes out at Hanamir and carves into him with its hooked beak. Hanamir stabs back at it, but it’s hard to tell if any of the blood on the owlbear’s feathers is its own or if it has all spurted directly from a half-orc artery. 

Tannin flies into a barbarian rage and punctures the creature’s back with his trident. As he pulls out the weapon, the owlbear turns to stone.

“HA!” he cries triumphantly. “Another new power!”

While Hanamir is struggling to stanch the flow of blood from his beak wound, he also waves an arm in warning.

“Look away!” he hisses. “No, Tannin, don’t look in my direction. I believe a basilisk may be behind me. Tannin, seriously, don’t look around the owlbear statue. The basilisk turned it to stone.”

Before shutting her eyes, Galadriel casts Healing Word on Hanamir and Stinking Cloud in the direction of the petrified owlbear. Hanamir and Tannin, as well as whatever is behind Hanamir, are enveloped in a thick and noxious fog.

From above, Harlan casts Call Lightning. A thick bolt of lightning splits the cloud for a moment.

“Did I hit it?” shouts Harlan.

“Maybe,” Tannin shouts back. “You didn’t hit me, at least. Hanamir?”

“I’m good,” says Hanamir. “I think I’m close to it. I’m going to try to get a hit—” 

The party can hear Hanamir’s sword connect with something scaly.

“I don’t need eyes to kill this thing!” roars Tannin. Harlan and Galadriel can see the faint glimmer of his trident spinning in all directions until he, too, hits something solid. “Ha! Found it!”

The trident acts a bit like a fan and blows some of the stink cloud away. 

“Don’t look!” Hanamir warns again. “Eyes closed, everyone!”

Galadriel casts Mage Hand. A small, golden-glowing facsimile of her own hand appears before her. She directs it to undo the buckles holding her bedroll in place atop her backpack, and then slowly carry the blanket in the air to the place where she can just about glimpse the prongs of Tannin’s trident above the cloud. The floating hand drops the blanket, dispersing more of the cloud, and leaving a reptilian-shaped lump under the bedding.

“Ah, well done,” says Hanamir. He stabs the lump through the blanket a few times, to be thorough. “Got him.”

“Bad news about your bedroll, though, Galadriel,” says Tannin. 

Harlan directs Zotz back to the ground. 

“We should probably be careful handling this,” he says. “Keep it wrapped in the blanket, maybe, until we’re sure it’s safe to look at.”

“I know these critters sell well in some circles, but don’t know what for,” muses Hanamir. “Alas, Hermione might know.”

“Something about the organs, I’m pretty sure,” says Harlan.

“We can take it with us, and ask her when we meet up outside Aberith,” says Galadriel.

Tannin volunteers to carry the basilisk corpse. He slings it over his shoulder in the bedroll like a sack of potatoes, then pulls out a small pad of parchment and adds a line to what must be his (very short) inventory.

“One (1) basilisk corpse,” he intones in time with the scratching of his quill.

“Now, as for owlbears,” says Hanamir, “I hear these grill up nicely in steak form.” He makes quick work of butchering the smaller owlbear.

The other one is still frozen in place, a permanent stone statue of an enraged owlbear in the center of the clearing.

“Too bad about this one,” says Tannin. “I guess we could carve our initials into it, though?”

The adventurers sit down for a short rest in the statue’s shadow, and one by one, they take up Hanamir’s chisel and make their marks on the base of the stone. During this idle time, the Savage rejoins them. He has attempted to diminish the cuteness of toting a gnome on his shoulders by fashioning a makeshift gnome-sized baby bjorn. Obviously, this backfires, and the effect is cuter than ever.

Now bereft of a bedroll, Galadriel and Buddy lounge on some cushy moss.

*Hey Buddy*, thinks Galadriel. 

YEAH?

*You know anything about basilisks?*

NEVER RUN INTO ONE MYSELF. BEFORE NOW, THAT IS. QUITE A FIND.

*Really?*

WELL, I’M SURPRISED TO SEE ONE AROUND HERE. BUT THAT’S ABOUT ALL I KNOW. SORRY I CAN’T BE MORE HELPFUL.

*That’s okay! Thanks anyway.*

She closes her eyes and strums her lute, but quickly falls asleep.

The ground becomes swampier as they approach the coastal region of Aberith that afternoon. From his scouting position a few paces ahead, Hanamir falls back.

“Voices ahead on the path,” he says. “Sounds like Undercommon, but I could be wrong. Anyone speak it?”

Tannin raises his hand. The voices are growing slightly louder, and he can pick up some of what they’re saying.

“Something about… ‘the twelve supreme entities gather around a table and laugh at us… dividing the world into dark and light.’ Something like that,” Tannin translates.

“Resentment of the gods?” says Harlan. “Seems like someone we may want to check out, what with all this god-killing going on.”

“All right, want me to say hi?” says Tannin.

“Yes, but I will elect to stay hidden.” Hanamir disappears behind a tree.

“G’day,” shouts Tannin, as two drow appear around the bend. They are dressed in simple drow attire, not displaying any particular religious or military affiliation. 

“G’day,” the drow nod their heads at Tannin. “You all speak Common, mate?”

“Yes,” responds Tannin in Common. “Thanks.”

The drow continue in heavily Undercommon-accented Common.

“Don’t see too minny trevelers out here,” says the older one. “Where you all hidded?”

“To Aberith,” says Galadriel. “A first visit for us all.”

“Ah, yis! Ebberith. We just came from thet way. Now hidded off on a bit of a walkabout, up to the mountains. Oi’m Nim, by the way. And this is my son, Nizana.”

“Wonderful to meet you both,” says Harlan. “You know, we couldn’t help but overhear that your son might have gotten up to a bit of trouble with the gods…?”

“Oh? Wott’you mean by thet, then, mate?” 

“Sorry,” Galadriel interrupts. “It’s a sensitive topic, I know. I was recently ensnared in an evil spider cult myself, and I know how easy it is to run afoul of the gods. I just wanted to offer my support, that’s all.”

Nim glances at her gauntlet.

“D’you follow Lolth, then?” he asks.

“Yes, but…” Galadriel hedges. “Maybe not so much by choice.”

“See!” Nim gives Nizana a soft punch in the arm. “This is what I was troying to till you! The gods, they eckt like we’re their playthings. They’ve enslaved us. She isn’t even a drow, and they’ve got her mixed up with Ol’ Cobwebs!”

“Might I ask what happened?” asks Harlan. 

“Wot?” 

“We mean, what made you feel this way about the gods?” asks Galadriel. 

“I hed my eyes opened, thet’s all, mate. There’s this priest in the kepital who’s got it all figured, roight? Now I’m just troying to do the same for my son. He’s been indoctrinated from choildhood to worship these toyrants.”

“We’d certainly be interested in hearing this priest’s teachings,” says Harlan. “He’s in Aberith? What’s his name?”

“They call him the Missinger, and he’ll sit you straight all roight, mate,” says Nim. He nudges Nizana again. “Think—wot if when he was a baby, I gave him a loaded crossbow and walked away? Oi’d be a tirrible parent. That’s wot the gods’ve done! Gave us all this meggic, then left us to kill each other with it!”

“The Messenger, all right, thank you,” says Galadriel. “We’ll look out for him when we get to the city.”

“If you esk around, you’ll foind him,” says Nim. “Safe trevels, then!”

“Oi,” says Tannin, as they walk away. “Want any owlbear steaks? For the barbie? We got tons.”

“Nah, no thenks, mate, ‘preciate it!”

When the drow are out of sight, Hanamir reappears. The adventurers discuss what they just heard as they set up camp for another night.

“How much you wanna bet the Messenger is somehow related to the Lich?” says Tannin. “Trying to get people on his side, trying to make people want to kill off all the gods...”

“Could be,” says Hanamir. “Or just your standard demagogue. Hard to say until we see him for ourselves.”

“Nim really did not like my amulet of Kord,” yawns Harlan. “He kept glaring at it.”

“He was not a fan of my gauntlet, either,” says Galadriel. “But I think he saw us more as poor suckers than as agents of evil.”

“Stop talking,” commands the Savage from his sleeping bag a few yards away. 

“Lots to think about, that’s for sure,” whispers Harlan. He holds his amulet, turning it over and over. 

As he sinks into sleep, he wonders if he’ll dream about being the slayer of Kord again.
