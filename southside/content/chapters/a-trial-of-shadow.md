Limping, [Chunk](/characters/chunk/) leans on [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) and [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) as they proceed through the door and back to the empty, snow-blanketed field. The ghostly king’s armor glimmers like ice in the muted sunlight. He surveys Chunk’s condition without reaction.

“You have done well,” he says. 

“Yeah,” says [Tannin](/characters/tannin/). “All right, are we cleared to take this last one? The ‘significance of being a loser,’ or whatever it was?”

“The meaning of loss,” says the king.

The two dwarves stare at each other, neither one’s poker face relenting.

“If you would like to take a moment to tend to your wounded friend, that would be fine,” says the king.

“Thank you, again, sir, for being so chill,” says [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/). “And yes, we’d like to do that.” 

She casts Healing Word on Chunk. Harlan casts Cure Wounds. Together, they’re able to bring Chunk back to a level of health that seems... acceptable.

“Thanks, y’all,” says Chunk, smiling at them through still gritted teeth.

“Are we prepared for this, team?” asks Hanamir. “What do we think the ‘meaning of loss’ is going to entail?”

“It sounds, uh, fatal,” says Harlan.

“Maybe,” says Tannin. “But the only way out is through.” He pauses. “If any of you want to turn back, I understand.”

The adventurers stand in a semicircle before the ghostly king, none daring to be the one to speak next.

“All right, then,” says Tannin. “Let’s do this.”

The king waves a hand and conjures a plain white door before them. He gestures to it without saying another word. If someone were to make a cartoonish “...GULP!” sound at that moment, it’d have been appropriate. 

Galadriel surveys the group’s mood and, seeing it lagging, begins plucking an upbeat melody on her lute—something sort of like R.E.M.’s “Shiny Happy People,” except royalty-free. No one seems buoyed by this performance, but no one tells her to stop, either. They walk through the door.


---

The air on the other side is cold and stale, like the inside of a mausoleum. 

“Can anyone see in here?” asks Harlan. “Or is it just me?”

“Can’t see much,” says Chunk. “Feels like I’m just about to bump into someone, though. Like the room’s full of people.”

Tannin does a somersault and waves his arms around, but knocks into no one.

“I feel it too,” he says. “Check the walls, Moonwater?” 

He gives Galadriel a nudge. Her song, which had begun slowing and souring as the vibe of the room made itself known, finally diminishes to silence.

“Hey, look alive,” says Harlan, snapping his fingers. “You’re the only one of us at full health.”

But Galadriel stares into the darkness, hands trembling over the strings of her lute. 

*I sold them all out,* she thinks. 

It’s suddenly clear to her in a way it’s never been before. She’s always been able to keep it on the threshold of her awareness, never letting it in, ignoring its persistent knocks at her door. But there it is.

*Harlan was right. [Cazna](/characters/cazna/)’s waiting in the wings, and I’m... I'm deceiving a god. It’s going to catch up to me. She’s a god! And she’ll take everything I love. She’ll hurt my friends. She’ll hurt [Buddy](/characters/buddy/).* 

Her eyes well up with tears. She hides her face in her hands.

*And for what?*

"Uh oh," says Chunk. He turns to his left, where Hanamir stands silent and motionless. "Mr. Hanamir? You all right, fella?"

Hanamir feels a cold dread settling on his brow and creeping down the sides of his face.

*Perhaps it's time I admit I've failed,* he thinks. *In all those case files, did I stop to interrogate my own role in the predicament that threatens thousands of lives?*

He clenches and unclenches his fists.

*I was careless with the library books. I failed to protect them. The tuning forks, after all, were inside them, and whatever grim machinations were set in motion when [Khargol](/characters/khargol/)'s goons used them to enter the City of the Dead... all the terrible things that have befallen Ivrend since then... must ultimately be the result of my failure.*

He hears a soft rustling of cloaks and feels a clammy breath against the back of his neck. 

Someone looms behind him—he sees tusks peeking out from beneath a dark hood. He swivels in place. An orc priest stands silently; armed, surely, but making no move to attack. Behind Chunk stands a wood woad; behind Galadriel, a giant spider. It's unclear—to him, anyway—what significance the figures behind Harlan and Tannin have. They are cloaked and shadowy beyond recognition.

Chunk swings his great club at the woad behind him. It falls back in recoil from the blow, but it makes no sound.

“Are we just supposed to leave?” asks Harlan. “Is that the true meaning of loss? We lose the fight by forfeiting?”

“Maybe,” says Galadriel. “Wanna try the door?”

Tannin watches Chunk raise his club again, and his hand finds the hilt of his trident, but he takes a moment to think. 

“Why haven’t these monsters said anything yet?” he thinks aloud. “That last trial, the feywild one, we couldn’t get that person to shut up.”

He whirls in place and brandishes his trident at the cloaked figure who towers over him.

“Hey!” he shouts. “What’s your damage?”

The figure opens its mouth in a long, slow, mournful scream, but no sound comes out.

“Maybe they’re undead,” says Harlan, with a note of optimism in his voice. 

He casts Turn Undead at the one that stands behind him, staring wordlessly. It does not react.

“It was worth a shot,” he sighs.

As if by clockwork, all the cloaked figures raise their weapons in unison to strike the adventurers. The only one who is able to dodge out of the way is Chunk, thankfully, whose health still hangs by a thread. In turn, Tannin, Harlan, Galadriel, and Hanamir all take severe damage.

"We'll reform the guardian trials after this," groans Tannin. "We'll try people for friendship, camaraderie, and coolness."

"Yeah, maybe people can be challenged instead on their baking skills," says Harlan.

"But what's the gimmick here?" says Hanamir. "Should we wail on these dudes? Maybe the point is that you can't. There's no obvious thing we're missing, is there?"

Hanamir takes a moment to explore the chamber. 

"This room is very small," he notes. "It's a tight fit in here with these monsters. But there are some abandoned weapons in the corner here, along the wall..." He pauses and rummages through them. "A two-handed hammer. Shortsword. A shield. None of them look to be in good shape. I think..." he pauses. "Yes, there are bones here, as well. Things did not go well for these people." 

Hanamir picks up the shortsword. It's an unremarkable weapon. But makes a sudden, swift turn and uses it to hit Tannin's monster, who stands closest to him now. The monster takes some damage, and the shortsword crumbles in Hanamir's hand.

Meanwhile, Galadriel takes a moment to connect with Buddy. She sends a thought out to him. 

*Do you know anything about this place?* she thinks. *And are you feeling all right? Everything about this gives me the creeps. I feel awful.*

HEY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. I FEEL TOTALLY FINE, LIKE I ACHIEVED A 20 OUT OF 20 ON SOME KIND OF THEORETICAL GAME OF CHANCE. I CAN SENSE THAT YOU'RE FEELING GUILTY ABOUT ME, BUT REMEMBER WHAT I'VE ALWAYS SAID: I'M HERE FOR YOU, AND I WANT TO HELP IF YOU NEED ME…

But Galadriel finds herself lost in rumination, even as Buddy tries to reassure her. His cheerfulness and good mood only underscore her sinking feeling that she’s going to get him killed. She whirls around and jabs the spider behind her in one of its eyes with her rapier.

Meanwhile, Chunk's monster—the woad—seems like it's already healed itself from the clubbing damage it took not a minute ago.

"Is it even real?" asks Chunk. He studies it. "It didn't make any sound when I hit it. Doesn't seem like it's fully here." He pauses again. "Is *this* something to do with the meaning of loss?" 

"Okay, okay, how about an experiment?" says Tannin. "Everyone kill yourself."

Chunk raises his club over his own head without protest, but Harlan holds up a hand.

"Whoa, whoa, whoa, let's hold on just a second," he says. 

"Yeah, what if we come out on the other side as force ghosts and we're guardians?" says Galadriel. "Maybe that's how king Butterfingers got where he is. The meaning of loss is you have to lose your life in order to be a guardian."

"I wouldn't put it past them," sneers Tannin.

"Maybe let's just hold off for now," says Hanamir. "And try some more traditional attacks first."

Chunk casts Call Lightning. The bolt slams down into the wood woad behind him and does some damage to Harlan's monster as well. The full, radical nature of this act causes Tannin to finally fly into the rage he'd been suppressing as long as they'd stood in the chamber. He starts smashing the ghoulish figure behind him with the blunt end of his trident, causing it to crumple to the ground. 

Harlan casts Shatter and pushes his own monster back toward the wall, but it quickly rights itself and returns to its place. Only the damage it took from Chunk's lightning appears to be permanent.

"Guys!" Harlan exclaims. "I think my monster only takes real damage when it's coming from someone who isn't me. Everyone, try attacking someone else's monster."

"So, we must help each other with our burdens," says Hanamir. "I knew there was a gimmick." 

The figures, in eerie unison, each disappear and reappear behind their original targets. Their attacks are sudden and precise. The wood woad deals a blow that knocks Chunk clean out; he falls to the floor, unconscious.

Galadriel shoots an arrow at Tannin's monster and hits it in the neck. Its form seems to flicker for a moment, and then becomes slightly translucent. Tannin sees this but finds no comfort. In fact, he realizes that his own life is probably meaningless. He accepts this thought as soon as it enters his mind.

*I'm going to end up like old [Borgrear](/characters/borgrear/)*, Tannin thinks. *Living without a tribe, out in the wilderness. He'll die alone, and so will I. I'll be the last McBitters... the last Snowmantle. Without a clan, what does any of this mean? Who am I doing this for?*

He sighs deeply, shrugs his shoulders, and decides he might as well hit some goon in the face anyway. He's good at that: compartmentalizing his anguish when there's a bad guy to be fought and a battle to be won. He stabs Hanamir's monster square in the gut with his trident.

In the next moment, the monsters hit again. Hanamir falls unconscious, but quickly wakes, blinking and shaking his head.

"Borgrear said he wasn't sure he passed his trials," says Galadriel. "Maybe he died?"

In opposition to this theory, Hanamir stabs Tannin's monster in the kidney. It evaporates. He smiles, his tusks glinting in the low light.

"Guys, Chunk is looking really bad," says Harlan. "I'm going to heal him. I think he might die otherwise."

He casts Healing Word and brings Chunk back from the brink. He's conscious again, but doesn't look like he's ready to rejoin the fray just yet.

Harlan then moves toward Chunk's monster, and in doing so, his own foe gets an attack of opportunity and lands a savage slice to his back. In that moment, a voice comes to him—it's one he knows well, but hasn't heard in a long time. And it's... in pain?

"You tolerate impurity while Lolth and her kin lay waste to what is good in the world," says [Kord](/characters/kord/). "And with my dying breath, I revoke your power." 

"Dying?" thinks Harlan, panicking in the moments before falling unconscious. 

Chunk is awake, yes, but his mind is full of fog. He feels unable, now, to understand how he ended up here.

*Why did I leave home, anyway?* he thinks. *To see nature twist and die on some soulless plane? The door is right over there. I could just go on home and live where I was comfortable, and leave these troubled individuals to their unnatural ways.*

The monsters hit again. He falls unconscious again, as does Hanamir. Galadriel and Tannin stand alone.

"All right, just in case all of us dying *isn't* the way out of this trial..." says Tannin. "You got any ideas?"

"I have one thing I haven't tried yet," says Galadriel. "I... have a new spell. It's a powerful one. I hope this works."

She concentrates hard and then, with a weird burst of sound, like a major chord played by several instruments at once, she turns into a Giant Ape. 

"Did it work? Am I a dragon?" she says. But all Tannin hears is "GRRR RARRGHGHG RAAAAAAA!"

She beats her fists against her chest and hopes that Buddy thinks she's a pretty dragon. Then she punches Hanamir's monster into the ground. When she lifts her fist again, it's gone.

"WHOA!" says Tannin. "Polymorph?! You got Polymorph?!"

He swings his trident at Hanamir's monster and lands a really nasty blow to its face. It fades, but does not disappear completely.

The remaining monsters shadowstep to their targets, and ready another attack. Horrifyingly, they do not spare those who are already unconscious. Chunk takes a wallop that looks like it might be fatal. 

Galadriel, roaring (and wondering why her acid breath isn't working), punches Hanamir's monster into the ground. She realizes her fist is a lot bigger than it ought to be. Do dragons even have fists? It's confusing. Anyway, Hanamir's monster is dead.

Tannin, instead of doing what he would normally do and continue to rage, decides to pause his reckless attack and go feed Chunk a healing potion. Chunk emerges from yet another moment of near-death, his eyes looking sunken and confused. But the monsters attack again, and Chunk is once again reduced to a big blue sleeping giant on the floor of the chamber. 

Galadriel rounds on Chunk's monster and punches it into the wall. It's fading, too, but not fast enough. Both Harlan and Chunk look grim.

Tannin rushes over to Harlan's side and feeds him the second healing potion. Harlan sits back up and takes a swing at Galadriel's monster, the spider, but he misses—it's not the best vantage point to attack from the floor. Hanamir wakes up of his own accord.

The monsters attack again, and Hanamir and Chunk are both unconscious once more. This time, though, Tannin is out of health potions. Galadriel decides to end her Polymorph spell and return to her usual form. She casts Healing Word on Chunk, who, again, looks the closest to death. 

Chunk sits up and casts Thornwhip on Galadriel's spider, pulling it away from Galadriel and allowing Harlan and Tannin to get an attack of opportunity on it as it passes. Tannin's trident carves a three-pronged gash in its side, and Harlan follows up with a blow from his maul that reduces the spider to a quickly-evaporating dark cloud.

Chunk's monster, the woad, hits him once more and knocks him completely out. 

"God, this must be the worst day of Chunk's life," says Harlan. 

Galadriel lines up an arrow and shoots it straight into the woad's mouth. It is gone in a puff of smoke.

There’s a long silence that unfurls in the chamber once the monster evaporates. Behind them, the white door fades away, leaving them alone in the darkness. 

“Now what?” says Galadriel between heaving breaths.

“Did we win?” says Tannin.
