The following chapter contains the first half of what historians have come to call “The Lost Episodes.” The original records of these events were destroyed.

Please be advised that the content herein has been pieced together from fragments of physical evidence combined with interviews from eyewitnesses. Memory is notoriously fallible, and witness testimony is therefore not always reliable. However, their recollections have been foundational to the purpose of telling this portion of the Southside Chillers’ story.

---

**Can you tell us a little bit about yourself?**

Sure. The name’s Huixtochihuatl, and I’m the ghost of a temple attendant who was entombed in the second tier of the pyramid. 

**As a ghost, what can you tell us about your day-to-day?**

It’s a lot of the same things I used to do when I was alive: I guard the shrine containing the relic of my personal deity, I warn intruders to stay away or face the wrath of the many-eyed god, and the rest of the time I think about all my regrets.

**Do you remember seeing the Southside Chillers pass through your section of the temple?**

I don’t know anyone by that name, but if you describe them… 

**You would have seen a human man holding an enchanted hammer, a one-handed dwarf wielding a trident—**

Okay, I’ll stop you right there. Yes, I remember the dwarf, and I remember his companions. Obnoxious, completely obnoxious. Even for tomb raiders. I first saw them when they were running up the stairs, laughing at their destruction of this holy place. They had swine with them. Swine! Stinking of… of panther’s blood and viscera. I could tell that they had just come from desecrating the sacrificial flaying chamber and slaughtering the oni’s familiar, and perhaps the oni himself. Outrageous.

**Did they see you?**

No. I deemed them unworthy to behold my beauty, which, as you can see, is unfathomable.

**Hard to fathom, indeed, ma’am. But did you interact with them in any way?**

I am named for the Goddess of Salt, so in death, I am blessed with a portion of Her power. When I saw these buffoons approaching the steam dragon trap, I imbued it with salt water so that their scalding wounds would sting like a hot ocean wave to the eyeballs.

**Where is the steam dragon trap?**

It’s at the top of the stairs to the second tier, right near where I haunt. And it was a later addition to the temple, so it hasn’t had as much of a chance to shine yet as some of the older traps. Which is a shame! Because it’s capable of steam-cooking a humanoid to death on the spot, sort of like how they do with lobsters, but better, because they can verbalize their agony.

**Is that what happened to the Southside Chillers?**

Sadly, no. They got out of the way before anyone was ready to be dipped in butter sauce. Though I did get a good salty steam burn on the bard, and she did complain about it a lot, so that’s something, right?

**Absolutely. Anything else you’d like to add?**

Just that I also watched them nearly inhale a centuries-old colony of mutated [stachybotrys](https://moldblogger.com/the-most-dangerous-molds/) that had made a home out of an illusory pile of gold coins in my hallway. It devoured the respiratory tracts of countless looters before them, but they burned it up with a torch like it was nothing. That mold was my friend.

**Thank you so much for your time, Huixtochihuatl.**

Foolish mortal! Leave this temple or face the wrath of the many-eyed god!

**FIG. 36-2:** *Shards of a mirror. Analysis of the break pattern suggests that the mirror was mounted on a wall, and that it was broken when spin-kicked by a humanoid of at least six feet in height—an impressive feat requiring unusual agility in such a narrow chamber. It was found near the entrance to the Shrine of the Couatl.*

**Mr. Frampton-Trogdor, it’s a pleasure to meet you.**

Please, please, just Frampton-Trogdor is fine. Nice to meet you too. 

**Would you mind walking us through what happened the day of your escape from the temple?**

Not at all. I’d been stuck in there for thousands of years, so getting out was the most exciting thing that’s ever happened to me, probably. I was so bored. You would not even understand how boring it was in there. I could try to describe it to you, but until you’ve been stuffed into a crystal cylinder and kept there for eons, you just won’t get it. You think about every little dumb thing you ever did to end up where you are, and you berate yourself, and eventually you start to wonder how long it’ll be until the sun explodes.

**So, the day you escaped. What’s the first thing you remember?**

Oh, right. Yup. Well, I remember the sound of the mirror shattering outside my door. I just thought, “oh boy, the worshipers are feisty today.” Time had really lost all meaning to me at this point, so even though there hadn’t been any living devotees to my shrine in centuries, it’s not like I knew that. It could have been a week, for all it mattered to my sense of temporality.

**When did you know that this wasn’t a regular visit from your acolytes?**

As soon as they walked in, I knew something was up. This was a weird, weird group, okay? A half-orc, a human, a dwarf, a half-elf, an elf, a tiefling, and a dragon disguised as a pig. That kind of variety doesn’t just happen, you know? Clearly, this is a group of individuals who’ve come together for some common cause. And it seems like they’ve been through some rough stuff, too, at this point, because the tiefling was wigging out like I cannot describe to you. Like, she was really losing it. 

**Losing it how?**

Screaming about dragons. And as a couatl, I’m sensitive to that, because people often lump us all together, like there’s no nuance, just because we speak Draconic too. It’s just ignorance, but you have to learn to deal with it. Anyway, the dragon in the group was playing it cool, but I could tell she was starting to get to him. Also, she was refusing to move, so the blue-haired elf had to drag her along. 

**When did you come up with your plan to trick them into freeing you?**

Right away. I knew I had to trick them into doing it, because they were so on edge, they wouldn’t have trusted me if I just came out and asked for it up front. They would have tried to kill me, and then I would’ve had to fight the dragon, and to be honest, I really didn’t want to do that. I’m trying to get out there and live life again, right? Not be maimed or killed fighting a Draconic brother because of some nervous oids.

**Pardon… oids?**

Humanoids. Oids. Sorry. It’s not rude, I promise, it’s just how we refer to you all in Draconic.

**Got it. So you decided to tell them they’d been poisoned, is that right?**

Yeah. And I don’t feel great about that. My goal isn’t to scare people. But I’d been trapped for so long that I didn’t know when my next chance to escape would come around. My sense was that these people had been fighting their way through the temple and were expecting hostility, so they’d be wary if I tried to introduce myself as someone sympathetic. And I sensed that they would be motivated by taunting.

**How exactly did you taunt them?**

Let’s see… well, they actually bypassed some of the dangers in the room. There were all sorts of pitfalls around the staircases surrounding the crystal cylinder that could have gotten them, but the half-orc went straight for the warrior statue. So I was all, “You better hope you can pass my tests or else you’ll die of poison,” and pretty much implied that the warrior was a test of their strength, so that only the worthy would be spared. And implied that they weren’t worthy.

**Were you at all nervous that the warrior would kill them all and you’d remain trapped?**

You know, I really didn’t think about that at all.

**The danger posed by the warrior didn’t occur to you?**

Not in any real sense, no. He was just one of those clay guys they enchanted in bulk and scattered around the entire pyramid. I guess he could have taken one of them out, but the whole group? Not likely. 

**I see. What measures did you take to make them believe they had really been poisoned?**

Oh, man. It was really basic stuff. Like, just making them feel a little dizzy, just enough to make them worry and wonder how bad it was gonna get. A little bit of a headache. I could have done so much worse. Like, I could have totally unraveled their perception of reality, but I’m not that mean.

**Plus, then they probably wouldn’t have been able to set you free.**

Good point!

**Once they had defeated the warrior, what next?**

So, that meant they had “proven their strength” to me, so I figured the next test should be something like a riddle. I told them that they’d need to use their cleverest person’s best tool to find the antidote in the core of the crystal cylinder.

**And did you know how they would interpret that?**

I wasn’t sure. It seemed obvious to me that their cleverest person was the dragon, but I think they assumed that I didn’t know he was really a dragon in that little pig costume. So they thought I was referring to the elf, which is kind of hilarious. But it worked out!

**So what would the dragon’s best tool have been?**

Ehh, I don’t know.

**Did you know what specifically they needed to accomplish in order to open up the crystal cylinder?**

No. I was hoping if I said something cryptic enough, they’d come up with the answer themselves. It’s kind of like fortune telling, or astrology, right? The interpretation they came up with was that the elf’s best tool was her brain, so they had her just come up and look at the crystal and think about it or something. And that’s when she saw the keyhole, and it just so happened that they had this magical key from some goblin friends of theirs, and so she was all like, “Eureka! I’ll use that!” 

**Did it work?**

Well, they didn’t really need the key. They just had to notice the keyhole. I’m honestly mad that that’s how easy it was for someone to let me out and it still took thousands of years to happen. But yeah, I suppose it worked.

**What was their reaction when you emerged from the crystal?**

Surprised! And a little afraid, which I get. But they mellowed out as soon as I started giving them treasure. Oids can be so predictable.

**Are you sure that word isn’t rude?**

Hahahaha, don’t worry about it.

**Okay. So you’re out of the crystal, and you’re giving them treasure.**

Yup. And they’re actually really sweet. They ask me my name, and I realize I don’t have one. Or if I did, I’ve forgotten it. Which definitely threw me, I admit. It was a tough realization.

**Wow.**

Yeah. So two of the names they’d thrown out as suggestions are “Frampton” and “Trogdor,” and they’re both so terrific, I had to just do both.

**They are great names.**

Thanks, yeah. 

**So, Frampton-Trogdor, what’s next for you?**

What *isn’t* next for me? Hahahaha. No, but I’m happy to say I’m returning to the celestial plane right after this interview to spend some quality time with the kids. I also spent the last couple centuries in that crystal thinking about starting my own brewery, too, so there’s that.

**Best of luck to you, sir, in all of your future endeavors.**

Same to you! Hey, any chance you can tell me what happened to those guys? The ones who freed me, I mean?

**I’m afraid I can’t.**

Aw. Bummer. Well, if you run into them, tell them I said thanks again and what’s up.

**I’ll be sure to do that.**

Oh, man. They didn’t die in the temple, did they?

**As I said, Mr. Frampton-Trogdor, I don't—**

Ugh. Okay. But let me know when you learn the rest of their story, okay?

**I will.**
