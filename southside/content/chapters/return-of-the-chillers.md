“Is this everyone?” 

“Yes,” lies [Harlan](/characters/harlan/). The original plan was to be upfront about leaving [Magick](/characters/magick/) behind in the Ruins, but these guardsmen seem totally uninformed as to the situation vis-á-vis the tiefling, so he figures, why bring it up?

There’s enough wine in the cask for the adventurers to share it with two low-ranking members of the Amber Guard. The more sociable of the two is a young man with distinctively round, pink cheeks who introduces himself as Dunwell.

“And this is my best friend, Dunokay,” he smiles, nodding in thanks as [Hermione](/characters/hermione/) pours them both some wine. Dunokay has the shadow of a mustache struggling to make itself known on his upper lip.

“Very nice to meet you both,” says Hermione. “I saw you won the jackpot earlier, when we were boarding.”

“Yes!” chuckles Dunwell. “It’s awkward to talk about, now that we’re face to face with you guys, but yeah, no one really expected any of you to survive. Right?” He glances at Dunokay, who nods sheepishly. “Our briefing was basically, like, we need you guys to go on this errand to the Northern Ruins to pick some people up, but they probably will be dead, so just enjoy the ocean air.” He chuckles. “What were you folks doing for Aberith in the Ruins, anyway?”

“Unable to share many details, I’m afraid,” says Harlan quickly. “But we’re glad you showed up. What have we missed back in the city?”

Dunokay takes a deep breath through his teeth with a roll of his eyes, as if to say “whoa nelly!” Dunwell laughs and shakes his head.

“A lot,” says Dunwell. “Two council seats about to be vacant, now that old [Nyanceth](/characters/nyanceth/)’s on bedrest. They say he doesn’t have much longer. But the big question right now is who’s going to succeed [Pouru](/characters/pouru/), and, well, you’re talking to two big fans of Jao Vedit, for obvious reasons.”

“Jao Vedit?” asks [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/).

“Head of the Amber Guard,” says Dunwell. “But [Slee](/characters/slee/) might end up going with someone from another branch of the military. Tough to say. In any case, the general’s execution is coming right up, so we’ll know soon.”

“Oh!” says [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/). “We were there for her trial, but not her sentencing. That’s…” she trails off. 

“Good,” says Hermione, finishing the thought. She looks around at them all incredulously, as if shocked by their reluctance to agree. “She imprisoned me! I mean, us! Without cause!”

“It just seemed like maybe there was more to it than that,” muses Harlan.

“Yes, at the trial, her behavior was quite odd,” says Hanamir. He turns back to Dunwell. “So you’re hoping for an Amber Guard representative in the king’s council?”

“That’d be ideal,” says Dunwell. “Or, if not Vedit, then someone who at least values our work a bit more. We’re all sick of enforcing this anti-magic ban.”

“Do you think that’d come to an end under a different Minister of War?” asks Hanamir. 

“We just need someone in the council who’s going to stand up to the AMLs instead of passing ridiculous laws to appease them,” says Dunwell, becoming agitated. “That mob of *subhumans* has totally derailed our work, *and* our way of life in Aberith. I’ve had enough.”

“Subhumans?” asks Harlan, with a nervous look around the group at his several nonhuman friends.

“Yeah,” says Dunwell. “No disrespect to present company, of course, but these street rats who have gone missing? Who are we kidding here? These are goblin riff-raff who got drunk and wandered away.”

There’s a silence during which almost everyone takes a sip of wine.

“Do you know anything about the Messenger?” asks Galadriel, changing tacks.

“Yeah,” scoffs Dunwell. “That’s their prophet, I suppose. He’s the one teaching all this nonsense.”

“Have you ever seen him?” asks [Tannin](/characters/tannin/). 

“Ha,” says Dunwell, “no, I don’t go to that part of town. These days, we’re too busy slapping fines on low-level magic users to flex our powers where they’d be useful. The Amber Guard is home to Aberith’s finest practitioners of the arcane, and they have us on babysitting duty. What a joke.”

Tannin leans over to whisper in Harlan’s ear.

“There’s still time. We can throw these two overboard, take this boat, and use the quiznos to defeat the Lich,” he says, not really quietly enough for the key words to be inaudible. “Mercenary style!”

“I have some bad news for you,” says Harlan. “All the people we know who can regenerate hands are in Aberith.” 

He pats Tannin on the shoulder. Tannin stares at his wrist stump and sighs.

---

At Aberith’s port, [Buddy](/characters/buddy/) stops short before following Galadriel into the city.

GALADRIEL? HEY. I CAN’T GO IN THERE.

*Why? What’s up?*

SOMETHING IN THE CITY IS…  I DON’T KNOW WHAT IT IS, BUT I CAN FEEL IT TRYING TO TURN ME BACK TO MYSELF.

*Damn, thanks for the heads up. Where will you go?*

I CAN STAY HIDDEN AROUND THE HARBOR. 

Galadriel nods. She watches as Buddy waddles down the dock and disappears around a corner. His voice reappears in her head one more time, though he is out of sight.

BE CAREFUL IN THERE. YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO USE YOUR SPELLS.

Galadriel communicates this to the party, who are understandably cautious.

“I was hoping we could go pick up Zotz before we do anything else,” says Harlan. “But now I think maybe we should split up. I’ll go get Zotz, but we need to get information from Slee about what’s going on as soon as possible, and update him on our… status.” He pats the concealed holster carrying the quiznos.

“You can’t just walk around with that thing by yourself,” says Hermione. “Especially not if you can’t defend yourself with magic.” 

Harlan chews his lip. He doesn’t like it, but she has a point.

“All right. Hanamir, will you take it while I fetch Zotz?” 

Hanamir assents. They pass the quiznos in its holster between them as if it is any common dagger rather than the weapon of mass destruction that it is.

Harlan waves at them as he walks off in the opposite direction to the rest of the party. 

“If you’re all set, then, let’s take you to see King Slee,” says Dunwell. “We’ve heard he’s thrilled you made it back.”

---

Indeed, when the adventurers walk into the council chambers, they are greeted by applause and a standing ovation from Slee, [Mirama](/characters/mirama/), [Kandir](/characters/kandir/), and an amber-robed man who must be Jao Vedit. 

“Welcome back!” says Slee, looking relieved and delighted. “We’re so glad to see you. Was the mission a success?”

“We would like, if we could, to speak with you privately, your majesty,” says Galadriel, delicately. She looks to Hanamir, Hermione, and Tannin for backup. Hanamir and Hermione give affirming nods; Tannin is beaming at Mirama.

“This is a closed chamber, Ms. Moonwater,” says Slee, confused. “The council sent you on this mission. We’ve all been eagerly awaiting to hear of its results.”

“Your highness, it’s only that we—haven’t met everyone in the room,” says Hermione, faltering.

“Oh, you mean Vedit?” says Slee. 

“I’d be willing to excuse myself, if my presence is a discomfort,” says the amber-robed man. He bows graciously and exits the room.

“Thank you, sir,” Galadriel calls after him.

“Now it’s just us,” says Slee. “What happened in the Ruins?” 

Hanamir, Hermione, and Galadriel trade uncertain glances.

“Could we *please* speak with you alone, your majesty?” Galadriel tries again.

“Ms. Moonwater, this is my council—or what’s left of it,” says Slee. “As you know, we’re running low on ranks lately. You’ll need to help me understand why I should dismiss my advisors.”

Tannin, already bored, looks ready to spill the beans. 

“All right, it wasn’t a success,” Galadriel blurts. “We failed. We would like to discuss the particulars of that failure in private with you, your majesty.”

The mood in the room changes abruptly. Hanamir, who has been watching Kandir’s reactions closely, notes that his face falls in a seemingly genuine expression of disappointment. It’s a little surprising how bummed everyone is, given that they only learned about the quiznos last week.

“All right. This is disheartening news. We had hoped to brief you about the situation with the Lich first, but since we’ll need a new plan now…” Slee sighs. “You may have your private audience, I suppose. Mirama? Kandir? If you would.”

The ministers of Justice and Trade file silently out of the room.

“What happened?” says Slee, sounding resigned. 

“Actually—” Galadriel begins, but then stops short. 

Something odd is happening to her vision. A veil seems placed over her right eye, crackling as if with static electricity. Her left eye is unaffected. And simultaneously, her gauntlet sends a sharp pinprick of pain up her right arm. She is reminded, discomfitingly, of her unresolved encounter with [Cazna](/characters/cazna/) in the apex of the pyramid. 

“Excuse me,” she continues, unsteadily. “I’m not feeling well. I need to be excused.” She gives Hanamir a significant look while flexing and unflexing her gauntleted hand. “I think you can take it from here.”

“Are you all right?” says Hermione. “Need me to come with you?”

“No, no, I’m fine,” says Galadriel, rushing out of the chambers.

---

Once Galadriel’s footsteps fade away into the hallway, Hanamir steps forward.

“Sire, we appreciate your confidence, and your agreement to dismiss your ministers,” he begins. “The truth is that we have recovered the quiznos. It is in our possession.”

“Oh!” says Slee, his eyes brightening again. “Then what was the failure?”

“I believe my colleague was being evasive because—while we know that we can trust you, sire—with an artifact of this power, it’s best if the knowledge is shared as narrowly as possible,” says Hanamir.

“But it will need to be turned over to the Amber Guard,” says Slee, not understanding. “They’re the ones trained in handling items of this nature.”

“But how do you know you can trust them with it?” says Hermione. “And—and—only one of us received the knowledge of how the quiznos is used.”

“We have experts in the Guard who could figure it out, I’m sure,” says Slee. “And if I am not to trust my own advisers, and my own Amber Guard…”

“You’re about to execute one of your advisers for treason, I hear,” says Hermione.

Slee sighs.

“Point taken,” he says. “But the fact remains that we must turn the artifact over to the Amber Guard. It’s simply too dangerous to be kept out of expert hands.”

Tannin punches the wall. 

“I knew it, I knew it, I knew it,” he mumbles. “Should have thrown them overboard, should have stolen the ship…” 

“The artifact is dangerous indeed,” says Hanamir. “And respectfully, sire, the matter of the secret ships to the Northern Ruins remains unexplained. General Pouru’s behavior at her trial indicates that something greater and more sinister than a simple betrayal may be afoot. We’re not sure what parts of your administration we can trust.”

“I appreciate your concerns,” says Slee. “And I’ll let this matter sit for awhile. Pouru’s execution is tomorrow, and I hope to put the matter of her treason behind us and move forward as a united council after that. Vedit will be the new Minister of War. He has headed the Amber Guard for many years, so I hope you can become comfortable with the fact that he will need to be let in the loop at that point.”

“Understood,” says Hanamir. “I propose a compromise: why don’t we, in the time between now and the execution, go speak to Pouru further and investigate any leads we might find? We’d need your explicit permission to do this, of course.”

“Yes, that sounds fine,” says Slee. “I will sign papers for you to speak to Pouru before she dies. But in the meantime, how do we keep the item safe? Can we trust it to an individual—Nyanceth, say?”

“But sire, we have heard Minister Nyanceth is in no shape to offer any sort of protection…”

“Yes, he is ill, but he is my most trusted adviser,” says Slee.

“I fear that if the news of his possession of the item were to leak, tragic consequences would ensue,” says Hanamir. He flexes a bicep and kisses it. “Whereas I have the wherewithal to keep the item safe.”

“I’m convinced,” says Slee. “Just for the day—and then we reconvene the council. At that point, Vedit will be sworn in as Pouru’s successor, and we will need a full report on your mission before the council. Kandir will brief you on the Lich situation as well.”

“Thank you for your forbearance, sire,” says Hanamir.

---

Hanamir, Hermione, and Tannin find Galadriel waiting for them outside the council chambers, leaning against a six-foot-tall obelisk made of clear, white-streaked quartz at the center of the courtyard.

“Isn’t this thing pretty?” she says as they approach. “I don’t remember it being here last time.”

“It’s fine,” says Hermione. “What happened in there? Why’d you leave?”

“Oh,” says Galadriel. “I got this weird feeling. Sort of a... Lolthy feeling. And something felt wrong with my eye—like maybe someone was watching us through me. So I left, just in case. But I actually feel totally normal now.”

“Hm,” says Hanamir. “Thank you for your caution. I think that was the right call.” He inspects the obelisk, searching for markings, but finds none. “We have about twenty-four hours before Pouru is executed. Slee is going to appoint Jao Vedit the new Minister of War, and he wants us to tell the truth about the quiznos to the full council at that point. But until then, we have permission to speak to Pouru and see if we can find any clues to her strange behavior.”

“Good,” says Galadriel. “Should we go talk to Pouru now? Is she in the same prison where she kept us?”

“Wait, I’m not done worrying about your eye,” says Hermione. She casts Protection from Evil and Good—or she tries to. But the spell fizzles in her hand. “Oh, that’s right. Buddy warned us we might not be able to cast spells in the city…”

Tannin, a couple yards away, casts Shape Water on a puddle. He seems to have more success than Hermione, but the water returns to its original shape quickly.

“Gals, try walking away from the obelisk,” says Hanamir.

She does so, and she grins at Hanamir.

“You’re a genius,” she says. “The obelisk is blocking whatever magic is allowing someone to spy through my eye. I can feel it breaking through—just a little—the farther I walk away from it…” 

“So we definitely can’t bring you in to talk to Pouru, either,” says Hermione. “Right? If someone—probably Cazna—is watching through you?”

“We could cut out your eye, and then just get that priestess to grow it back when I get my hand done!” Tannin suggests, helpfully.

“Hmmm,” says Galadriel. “It’s just that I’m *so* beautiful, and I don’t want to ruin that.”

“If it’s specifically your eye, I’m willing to bet it’s a visual feed only,” says Hanamir. “We could get you an eyepatch.”

“Ooh!” says Galadriel. “I bet I can rock an eyepatch.”

“So, next stop, the marketplace?” says Hermione.

“I want to get my hand back,” says Tannin. “I think I’ll go do that.”

“All right, we split up further then,” says Hanamir. “Are you all right with skipping the Pouru conversation, Tannin?”

“Yeah, I figure you guys’ll probably cover everything I have to say,” shrugs Tannin. “Tell her I said it sucks to suck.”

“Roger that,” says Hanamir.

---

General Pouru, whose mien had been one of sharp intelligence and a dignity, is a pitiful sight in her jail cell. It is clear that the guards, feeling betrayed, have been unusually tough on her, and that food, water, and cleanliness have not been priorities. Hanamir reaches through the bars of her cell and hands her his water skein. Pouru takes it and doesn’t look up until it is empty.

“You,” she rasps, recognizing them. “I don’t understand. Why are you here?”

“We believe there was more to your behavior at your trial than meets... the eye,” says Galadriel, sporting a new black eyepatch bedazzled with a rhinestone spider. “We were hoping to talk and get your side of the story.”

“Oh,” says Pouru. “There’s no other side to the story. It’s my handwriting. I signed the orders. I sent the ships.”

“Yes,” says Galadriel, “but we’ve recently witnessed a few cases of possession by evildoers who are able to take control of a well-meaning person and make them do things they wouldn’t otherwise do.”

“And you think this happened to me?” says Pouru.

“We think it’s a possibility,” says Hanamir. 

“Do you have any gaps in your memory?” asks Hermione.

“No,” says Pouru. “I remember giving the order. I remember wanting to do it. I don’t remember why I wanted it. But I did betray the crown. I did the thing I am sentenced to death for.”

“Have you met anyone new recently?” asks Hanamir.

“I met a few people at a dinner party,” says Pouru. “At Nyanceth’s a couple weeks ago. Just some of his old colleagues, and some well-connected nobles.”

“Did the whole council attend? And the king?” Hanamir prods.

“No, not the king, he wouldn’t typically attend something like this,” says Pouru. “But yes, Kandir and Mirama were there.”

“And did anyone offer you any food or drinks?” asks Hermione.

“It was a dinner party,” says Pouru flatly. “So, yes.”

Hanamir rummages in the Bag of Holding.

“General, if you allow it, I would like to use the Mirror of the Past on you,” he says. “It will show me visions from your past, and I’m hoping it may provide evidence of someone tampering with your free will.”

“Go ahead,” says Pouru. “My past is all there is, now. Very little future left.”

Hanamir produces the small mirror and turns it toward Pouru. In its surface, he sees a much younger version of the disheveled woman in the cell. She wears military garb; she swears fealty to Aberith. She climbs steadily through the ranks of its military, a clear talent, a rising star. A younger Haelon Nyanceth mentors her, and eventually relies on her—they discuss policy and strategy with a jovial enthusiasm that speaks to their shared devotion to their city and their king. 

“I didn’t know you and Nyanceth were close,” says Galadriel. “Last time we saw him, he seemed much closer to Kandir than to you.”

“Yes, a lot of things have changed,” says Pouru. She stares at the wall of her cell. “You all are looking for clues that aren’t there. I am guilty of this crime. Executing me is what I would do.”

“But why did you do it?” says Hermione. “If you can’t explain that, there’s something else going on. The Lich got to you.”

“I had no encounters with any Lich.”

“Then why did you do what you did?” Hermione says, exasperated.

Pouru has no response. 

“I think you committed your crimes under duress,” says Hanamir. “And while I agree that justice must be done, I also believe that justice without the truth is incomplete.” He pauses, thinking. “What changed between you, Kandir, and Nyanceth?”

Pouru smiles softly.

“Ultas Kandir,” she says, “is ambitious. Motivated. A lot like me, if I’m being honest.” She sighs. “I think he’s a good person, but he’s strong willed, and we clashed a lot in our early days on the council. Nyanceth and I rarely disagreed on anything, so when the two of us were united on an issue, Slee would usually take our side. And that was enough of a consensus for Slee, a lot of the time. It sidelined Kandir—and Mirama, though Kandir was the one who took issue with it…” She nods. “The collegial rivalry turned into something more over the years. But Kandir was the only one to come visit me in prison. I think we’ve both realized that we took it too far. It was a political rivalry, and he won.”

“He came to visit you?” asks Hanamir. “What did he have to say?”

“Oh,” Pouru says, suddenly quizzical. “He just came to…” She trails off. “I’m not sure.”

“Ha!” says Hermione. “*Ha!* Now doesn’t that strike you as odd?”

Pouru shrugs.

“It’s been a difficult few days,” she says. 

Hermione, Galadriel, and Hanamir take a moment to huddle out of Pouru’s earshot.

“Aren’t you glad we insisted Slee dismiss the ministers?” hisses Galadriel. “It’s all Kandir! He’s so shady!”

“We need to find out what he did,” says Hermione. “Can we sneak into his house, or something? Hanamir?”

“We could indeed,” smiles Hanamir.

---

Hermione decides to leave the sneaking to Hanamir and Galadriel—deferring to their combined powers of stealth and spider-climbing—and head to the Kiln instead.

“I’m hoping someone down there can sell me a scroll of Detect Magic,” she explains. “I’m tired of asking Harlan to cast it all the time.”

As night falls, Galadriel and Hanamir make their sneaky way to the well-to-do neighborhood Hermione indicated as being the home of Nyanceth. It’s a solid bet that the ministers would all live in the same general area of the city, and it’s not long before some deduction based on security detail leads them to an estate that can only belong to Ultas Kandir. 

“Oh, no,” says Galadriel, spotting another obelisk standing near a picturesque streetcorner nearby. “More obelisks. I might be useless here.”

She adjusts her eyepatch and tries to spider-climb up the side of the obelisk. She slides down.

“Want to turn back?” asks Hanamir. “I suppose this means I can’t cast Pass Without Trace, either.”

“I don’t want to give up,” says Galadriel. “You’re still pretty sneaky. I’ll wait for you here and back you up if you need me.”

Hanamir nods and tiptoes quietly closer to Kandir’s house. As he approaches a window, however, two guards turn a corner and spot him.

“Freeze!” a guard shouts. “Hands in the air!”

Hanamir slowly raises his hands, then gives the guards a big thumbs up and a befanged grin. He darts away, but stumbles on an exposed root. The guards dive onto him.

From the obelisk, Galadriel nocks an arrow and prepares to let it fly, waiting for a clear shot at one of the guards. But in the next minute, the burly half-orc has thrown off the two guards and has made a dash for the river that separates the north side of Aberith from its less-posh southern side. 

“Halt!” shouts one guard. The two officials scramble to their feet after him, but Hanamir is yards ahead. Before they can even break into a full run, he has already jumped feet first into the dark water below.

Galadriel sees her only chance. She sprints across the lawn toward Kandir’s house. She hoists herself up to a window, cursing the realities of climbing without the aid of the gauntlet, and disappears into the home of Aberith’s Minister of Trade.

As if prompted by the party’s full five-way split, something unusual happens: the night sky burns red for a full three seconds. 

Each adventurer—from Harlan at Elris’s farm to Hermione in the Kiln to Tannin at [Deru](/characters/deru/)’s temple to Hanamir floating downriver to Galadriel alone in Kandir’s house—watches as a massive fireball swallows the sky over southeastern Aberith.
