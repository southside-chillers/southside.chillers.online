The corridor beyond the narid’s pool room is flooded. The water that sloshes against their legs and soaks into their boots is icy cold, and far too deep for Buddy to walk through comfortably, so he resumes his old post peeking out of [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/)’s backpack. 

The adventurers round a corner and the flooding abates somewhat. A short set of stairs leads out of the damp and up to a set of bronze doors. [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) approaches first.

“Looks unlocked,” he whispers. He presses an ear to the doors’ surface. “Nothing moving on the other side that I can hear.”

The adventurers hesitate, then nod at him to proceed. Hanamir pushes the door open gently. It opens into a long, empty room—about a hundred feet of dusty stone floor lined by mosaic-laden walls. Galadriel puts Buddy down again, and he trots off to sniff the seam between the floor and the wall.  

“These are incredible,” says [Harlan](/characters/harlan/), scanning the mosaics. “Such detail in the battle scene, and very little damage despite the obvious antiquity…”

At the end of the room, another set of bronze doors leads to a crossroads of hallways. In the center of the crossroads are four statues: a bear, a coyote, a bison, and an eagle. Something shiny glints in the eagle’s mouth. Hanamir takes the ten-foot pole and carefully knocks it out. The statue’s mouth snaps onto the end of the pole.

“Ah!” says Hanamir. “Ten-foot pole, what would I do without you?” He inspects the newly-ragged edge. “You’re an eight-foot pole now, but you know what? You’re my best friend.” 

He bends down and collects the shiny thing that clattered to the ground. 

“A bracelet!” He puts it on. His eyes widen. “I think... I’m immune to petrification. And I can cast flesh-to-stone.” He smiles. “Beautiful *and* functional.”

“All right,” says Harlan. “Let’s check these corridors out and decide where to go next.”

The corridor to their right is narrow and dark except for a faint light several yards down that bobs and flickers in midair. The hallway looks shabby, as if forgotten by the temple’s ancient custodian, or simply not meant for people to see. 

“Not my first choice,” concludes Harlan. 

The other corridor—much more civilized-looking—leads to an alcove with a pedestal at the end, and a silver coffer resting on top of it. Hanamir approaches it and, seeing that it is unlocked, pushes it open with the eight-foot pole. A copper figurine rests inside. It is in the shape of some kind of humanoid sea creature, almost like a narid. 

[Hermione](/characters/hermione/) picks it up and inspects it.

“It’s hollow,” she says. She gives it a shake, and they hear the sound of small particles shifting inside. “Filled with… beads? Or rocks? And it’s definitely giving off a magical aura.”

She turns it upside down.

 “Elvish! It’s inscribed with a name—Ilnidra—though that doesn’t mean anything to me.” She glances at Galadriel, who shakes her head.

“Can I hold it?” Galadriel asks. Hermione passes the figurine over. Magic looks on with transparent envy. “I wonder what the beads inside are for. What happens if I take one out?” She pops open a hinge at a seam in the bottom of the statue, and picks out a bean-shaped bead the color of a hazy sunset. 

At once, the statue leaps out of her hand, spilling the remaining beads all over the floor. It zooms back and forth through the air, knocking against walls until finding its way down the hallway toward the cramped and dark corridor with the pulsating light. 

“What was that?!” says [Tannin](/characters/tannin/), gripping his trident. He is tensed, like a puppy resisting the urge to chase a tennis ball. “Do we follow it?”

“I think we have to, now,” says Hermione, with some exasperation.

“I didn’t know that would happen!” says Galadriel.

“Oh, nah, let’s forget about it,” says Hanamir, approaching the next set of doors with pole in hand. “Easy come, easy go, right?”

He’s the only one who takes this cavalier attitude, however, and he is quickly overruled. 

Galadriel leads them back toward the narrow passageway with the glowing light. It bobs ahead of them, with no sign of the floating figurine. 

“Your light awaits,” Hanamir says, in an unusual burst of sass. He bows to Galadriel, shirking his usual leadership responsibilities. Galadriel rolls her eyes. 

“Honestly, one hallway is as just as good as another,” she mutters. “There’ll be something deadly no matter where we go.”

“Those are some good last words, Gals,” Hanamir chirps. Harlan and Tannin snicker.

Galadriel walks ahead toward the light. It dances in the air, then moves backward as she moves forward. It leads them down the hallway until it disappears around a corner. There, the corridor widens, and the adventurers see a pit in the floor. Beyond the pit is a wedge-shaped block that lies in the way of the entire space, floor to ceiling, ahead. The light bobs away and disappears behind the wedge.

“Skeletons in the pit,” says Magic, unprompted. She is taller than the rest of them, and is peering down into the empty space ahead. “Two skeletons. Humanoids. Ten feet down.”

“Great,” sighs Hermione. “I think maybe we stop here and turn back.”

“Unshackle me?” says Magic. “For helping?”

“No,” says Hermione.

Hanamir takes a copper coin from his bag and chucks it down into the pit. They hear it clink against the floor unremarkably. 

“I’ll climb in and see what I see,” says Galadriel. 

She spider climbs down the nearest wall of the pit and then approaches the skeletons cautiously. They are long-dead, perhaps even ancient. One of them is probably human, and one has the distinctive skeletal markers of an elf. Galadriel has a distinct feeling that she’s seen enough when she gets a better look at the scratch marks on the surfaces surrounding the skeletons. She climbs back out onto the other side of the pit.

“Exactly what it looks like,” she says, dusting herself off. There is enough space on either side of the pit for the other adventurers to pass, but they remain on the opposite side. “Are you guys coming or what?”

“There’s a giant block in the way,” says Harlan. “We could break through it with a spell, but we don’t want to risk the ceiling caving in on us, right?”

Galadriel leans her weight on the block. 

“I think it swivels, actually,” she says, straining. “I’m not very strong, but I think two of us could do it.”

“All right, then,” says Hanamir. Galadriel has proven to him that she’s willing to pursue the mysterious statue (and the floating light) as far as it takes, so he might as well get on board. He tiptoes past the pit in the floor and joins her in pushing the block so that it shifts on its axis, far enough to create a gap between the wall that a humanoid could fit through. 

“Here goes,” says Galadriel. She slips into the gap, followed by Hanamir.

“You three stay back for now,” says Harlan, holding up a hand. He and Tannin cross to the other side of the room, leaving Hermione, Magic, and Buddy huddled together by the corner turn. Hermione looks less than pleased.

Beyond the wedge, Galadriel and Hanamir see the floating light. It no longer keeps its distance, and it flickers as if laughing. It swoops through Hanamir. He feels his indigestion clear up, but no other adverse effects. Instead, he makes a quick hit with his short sword and feels it connect with something corporeal, a thickness in the air for a second, but then misses it with his unarmed attack. Galadriel’s rapier slices right through the air with no contact.

The wedge shifts again, and Harlan and Tannin appear. The light plunges through Tannin’s chest as he enters, and it looks like Tannin has been shocked—his hair stands on end, crackling and emitting a smoky odor. Hanamir swings at the light again with his sword and misses; Harlan does the same with his hammer. 

“I’m starting to think my first one was just a lucky hit,” Hanamir says.

“Time to switch gears,” says Galadriel. She turns to the light, squinting at the blaze in the dark. “Hi. I’m Galadriel. Who am I speaking with?”

A voice fills the corridor, speaking an antiquated, echoing Elvish.

“A guardian. I protect this area of the temple. I have done so since my death here on an expedition many years ago. Begone!”

“Are you an elf?” says Galadriel. “Are you… Ilnidra, from the inscription?”

“My name is Will,” says the voice.

“Oh. We’re sorry to have disturbed you, Will,” she says. “Where are you from?”

The light pulsates angrily, ignoring the question.

“What is your business here?”

“Just like you, my friends and I are on an expedition here,” says Galadriel. “We mean no harm. We were pursuing you because we found a statue that floated this way, and we wanted to learn its significance. We didn’t mean to intrude on your territory, and we’re sorry.” She pauses. “Did you see it go by?”

“That statue is one of many traps here,” says the voice of Will. “If you’re here to raid this place like I was, I must see that you meet the same fate.”

“Interesting,” says Galadriel. She casts Suggestion. “What if you decided instead to prevent the same tragedy that befell you from taking any more lives? What if you let us pass, and ended the cycle of violence here?”

The light wavers in the air, then emits a softer, warmer glow.

“Although I have trapped many in this corridor… I suppose you may pass. Be careful.”

“Thank you, Will,” says Galadriel. “And best of luck protecting your area in the future. We wish you well.”

The light bobs as if bowing, and then zooms back through the wedge, presumably to resume its original post. 

The adventurers signal to Hermione that it’s safe to proceed. She leads Magic and Buddy past the pit and the wedge, and the group ventures onward. 

The next passageway has an abundance of traps, both hidden and already-deployed. Hanamir triggers several of them with the eight-foot pole, while Galadriel scours the walls for any hidden switches. There are several more stone pressure plates in the ground, but the group is better at noticing these now, and sidesteps them easily. There is a dusty, sandy material trickling from significant cracks in the ceiling. It sits in piles on the floor. 

Hanamir continues throwing copper coins down the hallway ahead of them in case of motion-sensing traps, but it seems like the worst of the traps have already been deployed. They reach the next set of doors and pass through without much ado.

The next room is filled with foul, bitter-smelling air and has a few piles of rubble and bones around its perimeter. There are tiny lights moving on the floor. 

“Beetles,” says Harlan, peering down. One of the glowing bugs crawls over his boot. “I bet that’s their nest.” He points at a cluster of lights in the corner. There’s something shiny beneath them, reflecting their light. 

“Do we want to see what’s in the nest there?” muses Hanamir. “Or continue through one of these doors?” He waves at a door to the north and a door to the south. 

“Might as well get some treasure,” says Tannin. He stomps on a beetle, and it leaks glowing fluid onto the floor. “They’re just bugs.”

“Are we sure they’re just bugs?” says Galadriel. “Hermione, can you identify them?”

But Hermione is busy dealing with Magic, who has put a beetle in her mouth and refuses to spit it out, and disregards the question.

Harlan borrows the eight-foot pole and pokes at the nest of beetles. A few of them object to this and sink their pincers into his toe. But they do seem to be simple bugs, and they’re demolished within a few minutes of the adventurers tap dancing around the room. A few stragglers disappear into the cracks in the walls, and they are left alone to dig through the rubble.

Tannin tosses some pieces of rotten wood and cloth out of the way. 

“Some pretty rocks,” he reports. He picks one up. “Is this turquoise?”

“Looks like it,” says Harlan. “Add it to the Bag of Holding.” 

Tannin dumps it in.

“A dagger!” he says next, holding up a prodigiously rusty piece of weaponry. “Feels like this does more damage than a regular dagger. Must be enchanted.”

“Yeah, enchanted with tetanus,” says Harlan. He shakes the Bag of Holding. “Into the bag, if you must.”

There’s not much else of note other than a broken crystal and some polished, less-valuable rocks. Hanamir is already distracted, checking out their door options.

“This one’s interesting,” he says. He points to the doors with an Olmen inscription above them. “Tannin, can you read this?”

“Uhhh,” says Tannin, walking over to the door and glancing up. “Yeah. It says, ‘Beware, the many-eyed god will bring down a fiery death.’”

“Hmm,” says Hanamir. He prods at the door handles. “Shall we?”

“Seriously?” Galadriel laughs. 

“One hallway’s as good as another, right?” he smirks. “Something deadly no matter where we go?”

Galadriel scowls.

They enter a stone chamber containing two above-ground tombs. Upon each tomb lies a human figure, and between them is a stone table with a crystal flask and two crystal goblets. The room is silent as the grave.

The figures appear to be made of living flesh, but are unconscious, and have been for a very long time—they are covered in an inch or more of white dust. Harlan goes to inspect the goblets on the table.

“There’s some type of silver powder in here,” he whispers. “Like, a powder that looks different from the dust, I mean. Glittery.”

Hanamir puts his face up close to one of the figures.

“Looks like they’re wearing snakeskin under all this dust,” he murmurs. “The female figure here has a bracelet made of platinum, I believe, and is holding an ivory wand… the male figure wears an amulet with a large red stone of some kind. My guess is these two drank out of those goblets, and then lay down here, and haven’t gotten up since.”

“Mage Hand?” Tannin whispers to Galadriel. “We could wait in the beetle room and see if they react if we take anything…”

Galadriel nods. They all tiptoe back to the foul-smelling room and watch as the ghostly hand floats toward one of the sleeping figures. The bracelet slips easily off the woman’s wrist, but this does appear to be enough of a disturbance to end a centuries-long nap.

The man rises in a cloud of dust. The woman sits up.

“I am Cipatkonau,” says the man, speaking Olmen. “This is Oxomoko. You have broken our glorious slumber.” 

“What’s he saying?” hisses Harlan. Tannin translates.

The man says one more thing, and Tannin looks at his friends shiftily.

“Um... he wants to know how we plan to atone,” he says.
