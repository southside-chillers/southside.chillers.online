“We’ll use the doors, all right,” [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) says. “And we’ll walk in the field, too, if we want to.”

“Yes, yes,” says [Borgrear](/characters/borgrear/). “Suit yourself, young McBitters.”

Tannin stalks purposefully over to a door and wrenches it open. A broom falls and hits him in the face.

“Not that door,” says Borgrear. He points to the door to his left. “Try this one.”

“Wait!” says [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/), as Tannin moves to open it. “If we’re plane shifting, I don’t want anyone to get separated again. Let’s link arms.”

In a chain formation (and with considerable grumbling from multiple parties), the adventurers pass through the door into a room that looks identical to the one they just came from, except for the presence of heavy plant growth.

“This… looks like the same place,” says [Harlan](/characters/harlan/). “Are we sure this isn’t the same place?”

“And Borgrear just has two versions of the same foyer, but one’s trash-themed and one’s jungle-themed?” says Galadriel. “Maybe. [Chunk](/characters/chunk/), you recognize any of these plants?”

Chunk inspects the foliage that covers the walls. As he moves closer, a vine rises and touches his nose.

“Whoa there, fella!” says Chunk. “Nope, never seen plants like these before.”

The plants are pulsating and growing before their eyes. Large and brightly-colored fruits swell on vines circling the banister of a collapsed staircase. Little red flowers appear to be breathing, giving off a faint pink aura that makes the room warm with ambient light. 

“Look out the window,” says [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/). 

The crisp and cold mountain morning has been replaced by a dark jungle illuminated with softly-glowing magenta and blue flowers the size of dinner plates. 

“So, is this the Feywild?” says Tannin.

“A safe assumption,” says Hanamir.

“But look,” says Harlan. “Beyond the jungle, you can still see that snow-covered field.”

It’s true—the barren field, with timber and rock stacked neatly at its edges, is visible between two massive, undulating ferns.

“Interesting,” says Hanamir. “Perhaps we’re only in a small pocket of Feywild—a planar lookout point that intersects with the material plane.”

“Is that a thing?” Galadriel says, a little skeptically. She spiderclimbs up one vine-draped wall. A green tendril wraps itself around her hand. “Stop it, you!” she giggles, smacking it away.

Far from seeming satisfied by the exploration of a new place, Tannin seems even closer to bursting into a rage than he was before. 

“Team?” he says, his eyes flashing. “I’m here with you now. But I need something. We have to go into the other door.”

“You got it,” says Harlan.

They return the way they came, back into Borgrear’s filthy foyer, and pass without comment, arms again linked, into the door on the opposite wall.

“Pheeeeeew!” says Chunk. He waves a hand in front of his face, but there’s no dispelling the odor of decay that permeates this next room. Suddenly, he feels a strong sense that their quest is pointless, that all beautiful things in the world will come to ruin, and that he ought to just give up now.

“And this is the Shadowfell, then,” says Tannin. Even with darkvision, it’s difficult for him to see the walls a few feet away. He does notice Galadriel sink to the ground next to him and lie down on her back.

“Who are we kidding?” she murmurs. “The Lich will kill everything we ever cared about.”

Hanamir, too, holds his head in his hands and sits down, hugging his knees to his chest.

“Yes,” he says. “And the AML is probably destroying Aberith as we speak.”

“Uh oh,” says Harlan. “You guys okay?” He sniffs the air and waves his arms out in front of him. “I can’t see anything in here, but I don’t think our circumstances have changed *that* dramatically since we walked in.”

“Dead critters on the floor,” notes Chunk. “That’ll be the smell.”

“Borgrear said these were other guardians’ houses, right?” says Harlan. “How did anyone ever stand living here?”

“Rough deal for whichever guardian got this place,” agrees Chunk.

“I’ve seen enough,” says Tannin. 

Without another word, he opens the door back to the material plane, and with some gentle coaxing, the depressed members of the party follow along.

Borgrear waits for them in his crumpled chair by the trash fire.

“Did you find what you needed?” he asks. 

“Not at all,” says Tannin. “And we’ll be walking to the field now, and if anyone wants to challenge us on that, we’re ready.”

“Hold on,” says Hanamir, after translating this for the rest of the group. “Are we sure we want to face these trials?”

“I’m sure,” says Tannin. “The rest of you can decide for yourselves. But it seems like the only way to get the coin is to follow it to the city, and the only way to get to the city is to—”

“Remember, we do have the, um, *you-know-what*,” says Harlan. “Which can be used once a week to take us to another plane…”

“But we don’t know which plane the city’s on,” says Tannin. “Are we just going to pick one and hope it’s there?”

“And then wait a week to try the other one, if it’s not?” asks Chunk.

“Mr. Snowmantle,” Hanamir addresses Borgrear directly, “who administers these trials?”

“Spirits,” says Borgrear. “Spirits who will determine if you are worthy to defend the city.”

“Worthy? No doubt. But I won’t spend my life sitting here watching a field,” says Tannin.

“Your guardianship may indeed take a different form than mine, young McBitters,” says Borgrear. He reaches into a pocket and procures three small shreds of parchment. “Take these and show them to the spirit who greets you. He will know what to do.”

Hanamir, reading over Tannin’s shoulder, translates the Dwarvish script for the others.

“Spirit of the material plane, put upon me—well, upon *us*; there’s no distinction in Dwarvish—the… the weight of the world,” he says. “Spirit of the wild, show to us the truth of nature. Spirit of the shadow, show to us… the meaning of loss.”

The adventurers look at one another. Most eyes settle on Tannin’s brooding countenance, waiting for him to confirm his intentions.

“Friends,” he says, after a moment, “I think facing these trials is the path forward. To the three-sided coin, and defeating the clowns, and the AML, and protecting Aberith…” He trails off. “Maybe it’s crazy. Maybe it’s… misguided instinct. But we’ve been through a lot together, and we’ve defied the odds before, and if you can trust me on this—”

“We trust you, Tannin,” says Harlan.

Hanamir nods. Chunk clicks his tongue in apparent agreement.

“Yeah, of course we do, goofus,” says Galadriel. “Let’s do this.”

The snow that covers the field is like a sparkling white sheet. It crunches lightly beneath the adventurers’ boots.

“You know, the way he said it at first, I thought just by walking out here we’d get confronted by some kind of field spirit that would make us do the trials,” says Chunk. He looks around at the empty expanse. “Guess not.”

“You think we need to read the papers?” says Harlan. “And if so, which one do we do first?”

“I vote material,” says Galadriel. “Home turf, right?”

“Yes, material seems like a good starting point,” says Hanamir.

“Spirit of the material plane!” Tannin’s voice booms, in a regal Dwarvish that takes everyone aback. “Put upon us the weight of the world!”

A flurry of snow spirals up from the ground in front of him. In its wake, a semi-transparent, blue-tinged figure appears, a dwarf, dressed in the ceremonial armor of a king.

“Do you wish to commence the trials?” comes a voice, echoing as if from very far away. 

“The city is in danger,” says Tannin. “It’s been gone a long time. We want to be the ones to figure out why.”

The figure laughs.

“First, you must prove yourselves worthy,” he says.

He steps forward, raises his ceremonial hammer, and smacks it on the ground.

---

Four torches mounted in the corners of a twenty-foot stone cube of a room illuminate the adventurers’ confused faces. Carved into one wall, there is a corridor extending out about ten feet, and at the end of it, there is an unmarked stone door.

“Aw, jeez,” says Chunk. “I think we’re underground. I’m not one for… being underground.”

“The weight of the world…” murmurs Hanamir. 

He wanders down the corridor to take a closer look at the door. 

“No markings; no hinges; no visible locks,” he reports. He heaves a shoulder against it. “Immovable, or at least, not easily moved.”

Harlan crouches in the center of the main room, where a large orange diamond shape with a small red triangle inside seems etched into the floor.

“I don’t recognize this as any kind of religious glyph; it’s almost too simple to be one,” he says. “Tannin, do you have any insights on the kind of stone these walls are made of?”

“No,” says Tannin. He wanders toward Harlan and the shape on the floor. “But this thing?” He stomps on the red triangle.

“Whoa! Maybe let’s be careful with the strange symbols—” Harlan starts, but is cut off by a soft knocking sound from the corridor.

Galadriel, who is spiderclimbing the ceilings looking for clues, scampers along like a bug toward the source of the noise. 

“Hey, do that again,” she calls. 

Tannin stomps down on the red triangle once more.

“The door moves!” Galadriel cries. “Just slightly, but when you set your weight on that thing, it creeps up, maybe an inch… no, not even a full inch.”

She climbs down and lies flat on the floor in front of the door. 

“I can only see a few inches ahead,” she reports. “Something is behind here blocking the way.”

Tannin steps off the diamond-shaped plate. 

“Does the door go back down?” he calls.

“It does!” says Galadriel. “Maybe try two of you standing on it at once?”

Without warning, Chunk scoops Tannin up onto his shoulders and jumps onto the plate. Tannin gives an undignified yelp and punches Chunk between the shoulder blades.

“Yes!” Galadriel calls back to them. “More weight, if you can—whoa!” 

She does a sort of somersault jump and clings to the wall a few inches above two jets of flame that shoot out from beneath the partially-raised door. 

“Okay!” she says, upon catching her breath. “There are two glowing red runes under there. I think… I think they’re carved into the bottom step of a staircase? The color is fading now.”

“Anyone have anything we can prop the door with?” says Harlan.

“I got a crowbar in my backpack,” says Chunk, still holding Tannin over his shoulders like a sack of potatoes. “We could wedge it underneath. Or maybe a shield!”

“Or we can just add more people to this pile,” says Harlan. He squeezes himself onto the small platform, and the door ratchets up several more inches.

“Hanamir, I think you gotta join in that dogpile,” says Galadriel. “If you do, I think I can squeeze underneath here and see what’s on the other side.”

With a resigned sigh, Hanamir encircles Harlan, Chunk, and Tannin-on-Chunk’s-shoulders in an orc-sized bear hug as he steps onto the plate.

“All right,” says Galadriel. “Yeah. I think I can get under here.”

“Maybe the point of the trial is to crush you with the door,” says Tannin. “Weight of the world, right?”

“Uh, yeah, maybe,” she says. “Wish me luck.”

Back on the floor, as flat as she can make herself, she slides gingerly underneath the door, all too aware of its foot-thick stone heft that would very certainly smush her like a spider. But the dogpile of adventurers on the floor plate stands still. She makes it through to the other side and exhales.

“Yup, it’s a staircase back here,” she says. Her voice is faint from behind the door. “Two more glowing runes near the top. These are orange, though, not red. Still, I’m going to do my best not to trigger any more flame jets.”

“Do you see any mechanism that might control the door?” comes Hanamir’s muffled voice.

“Yeah,” she says. “Something… complicated… up on the ceiling. With gears.”

“Can you describe it in any more detail?” says Hanamir.

“Ummmm,” says Galadriel. She has climbed up the wall to the ceiling to get a better look, but with only the light from the runes at the top of the stairs, even her darkvision isn’t super helpful. “It looks like a mixture of science and magic. I’m kind of nervous about messing with it.”

“Maybe we should see what happens if we step off the platform,” Chunk’s voice suggests.

“Okay, as long as you step right back on it in thirty seconds or so,” says Galadriel, with a nervous chuckle. “I don’t want to be stuck in here. I’m so sick of getting separated from the rest of you.”

In a moment, the stone door slams to the ground. Galadriel rests an ear to its cool, smooth surface, but can’t hear even a distant sound of her friends’ voices. Notably, the runes at the bottom of the staircase begin to glow red again. It’s a long thirty seconds before the door lurches up again, with a few loud knocks from the machinery on the ceiling. Before she gets back into position to slide under the door, she jump-flips back onto the wall to avoid two fresh pillars of flame bursting from the staircase runes.

“Closing the door recharges the runes! Closing the door recharges the runes!” 

In a manner both cautious and hasty, she slides back underneath the door, breathing heavily.

“So what now?” says Harlan. “What do we have with us that’s heavy enough to lift this door all the way?”

“Maybe if we…” Galadriel trails off. Instead of finishing the thought, she clambers onto the pile of adventurers, prompting an “OW!” from Tannin when she reaches the summit (Chunk’s shoulders).

The door, it seems, had been waiting for this. With a series of solid-sounding *clicks*, it opens completely, revealing the stone staircase behind.
