We resume battle with Typhis, the angry marid! He has taken significant damage, but he's still kicking. He is flanked by four water Elementals under his command. Three of them have taken significant damage as well, while one of them is mostly unscathed. 

Fibsy, at the top of the initiative order, casts Fly, and jets away from the water Elemental that's currently attacking him. He floats midair and then uses his Eldritch Cannon as a bonus action, aimed at Typhus, avoiding the Elementals if he can. He does 14 damage to Typhus.

[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) flies down from his tree and lands on Typhis, who is prone. Despite being literally on top of him, he misses several blade attacks, but still lands a couple due to the advantage. He does 16 damage.

To join the fray, [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) jumps down from *his* tree and casts a Dwarven shadow over Typhis. He roars, wielding his trident, and makes several stabs with it for 33 damage. He rolls away and assumes an anime pose with the trident behind his back and one hand on the ground. 

Next, [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) targets Typhis with another round of Crush Mind. He succeeds on his intelligence save, so only takes 16 psychic damage. But cumulatively, Typhis is now feeling the pain of these repeated attacks.

[Chunk](/characters/chunk/) uses his turn to transform into a giant ape, readying himself for an attack.

Now the water Elementals are up, and they each target a different adventurer with slam attacks: Tannin and Galadriel get hit by massive waves, while Chunk somehow evades the two that break near him. 

Typhis now decides to assume his gaseous form again. He disappears into a cloud, but continues speaking in Aquan.

"Why is this lake so important to you all?" he directs his voice to Tannin. 

"It's not the lake," says Tannin. "It's that you've subjugated living beings, and you intend to take over this plane, which will just... subjugate more beings." He pauses. "I have no problem with you being here, man. It's what you're doing."

"I'll let you and your friends go, and we'll stay in our lake. But we cannot return to the Elemental Plane of Water," says Typhis.

"Including these Elementals who are here against their will?" says Tannin.

"They don't have will!" says Typhis. "They're much happier here than they would be on that wretched plane!"

"You should talk to them," says Tannin. "They want to go home. And maybe you should talk to us, too, about why you were banished from the source. Maybe we can help you get back."

"What began as banishment has been a revelation," says Typhis, clearly agitated. "The water plane is no longer a place I even desire to return to." This is clearly a touchy subject for him. "Perhaps... I could offer you something to make you look the other way on my lake."

"I don't think so," says Tannin. "You're messing this lake up for the people who live nearby. If you can come to appreciate the prime material plane for what it is, and find your place here, okay. We have good oceans, you know."

"This was the wettest place I could find," says Typhis. He sounds sheepish. "Would you help me get to one of these oceans?"

"Yes!" says Tannin, delighted by his negotiation skills in a foreign language while in a Barbarian rage.

As Typhis drops concentration, we see the water Elementals disappear, presumably back to the Elemental Plane of Water. Then, as Tannin holds out a water skein, Typhis turns himself into a goldfish and pops inside.

"We solved the water puzzle," Tannin announces to the other Chillers.

"Yay!" cheer the Chillers.

"And now we have an elf's corpse that we need to return, and a water genie in goldfish form that we need to take to the ocean," Tannin summarizes.

"It looks like we're not too far from the ocean," says Hanamir, inspecting the map. "Once we're past Peloria, it'd be a day or two's walk to the southeast."

"You know, Aberith is looking for a new Minister of the Sea," says Galadriel. "A water genie could be a great candidate."

"Hmm, what's our success rate with supervillain rehabilitation, though?" says Tannin. "Anyone know what [Magick](/characters/magick/)'s up to these days?"

The Chillers fall silent, considering this, and then busy themselves with packing up their things for the remainder of the journey to Peloria.

The rest of the walk is uneventful. The Chillers arrive in Peloria and see that it is laid out in concentric circles. In the center of town is a temple to Pelor, and surrounding it are three rings of houses and buildings, the nicest of which are closest to the center. The homes around the edges of town are in disrepair, some of them possibly abandoned. 

We see a few people walking around, but they do not greet us. Two elf women see us and whisper to themselves. We call out to an elderly man at a distance, but he doesn't respond. We remember what the Dwarven pilgrims told us about this town not being particularly welcoming to strangers.

The obvious place to go would be the temple, though we also notice a small general store. We decide to enter the store and see if we can get information about the two people we're looking for: Transa, the person of interest from [Kandir](/characters/kandir/)'s records, and Tairoy, the brother of B'ernii, the dead elf we found in the woods.

"Hail and well met," says the man behind the counter of the general store. "The name's Bubber. We don't get many travelers around here, but I'd be glad to help you all."

He gestures to a pretty standard array of items on display, such as rations, water skeins, candles, torches, and rope.

"Lot of level one adventurers in this town, huh?" asks Galadriel.

"I don't know what you mean," says Bubber.

Hanamir selects 10 gold's worth of rations and sets his coins down on the counter. Bubber shakes his head.

"I'd be glad to sell you these, sir, but I'm afraid I can't accept worldly money. We only accept Pelorian money. Little beads. The money from outside—it's tainted with sin, if you'll pardon me."

"So sorry," says Hanamir, picking his gold back up. "Didn't mean to offend."

"No, no, not to worry," says Bubber. "If you'd like to get some Pelorian money, though, you'd have to speak to the Elders and see what they can do."

"Would they be at the temple?" asks Galadriel.

"Some of them might be, but you know, they've been trying to deal with the disappearances, so they might be out..." says Bubber. After prompting, he explains. "Ever since the rains got bad, people have been going missing."

"Oh!" says Galadriel. She grabs the water skein that contains Typhis in goldfish form. "Well, good news—your difficulties with all that should be at an end. It was a water genie causing the excessive rain. And we've made a deal with him, and he won't be bothering you anymore."

Typhis looks alarmed.

"But... the cause is of course that Pelor is unhappy with us," he says.

"Oh," says Galadriel. "Yes. Think of all that as a metaphor. We found what was making Pelor unhappy, and we wrapped it up. And now he's all set. He thinks you're doing great. And, you know, he said to just, like, be excellent to each other."

It's clear that Bubber is now uncomfortable engaging with us, and wants to see us out. His voice is nervous as he says, "On second thought, we're having a special for new customers. You can have six rations free."

Hanamir rolls insight as Bubber ushers us to the door. He suspects that Bubber is afraid of these Elders overhearing him having a heretical conversation about the rain.

"One last thing!" says Galadriel. "Do you know Tairoy? Or Transa? We're looking for either of them."

"I thought you said you didn't know any Elders," says Bubber. "But you're here looking for Transa?"

"We don't know her," says Tannin. "We just have some questions for her."

Bubber clams up again, thinking he may have said something he shouldn't. But then he speaks up. 

"Leave old Tairoy alone," he says. "He's been through a lot."

We return to the street. Chunk suggests we find a shady merchant willing to exchange gold for Pelorian currency. Galadriel investigates, but doesn't find anyone remotely sketchy in such a small town. 

We decide to check out the Pelor temple next. Given that there are no half-orcs in this town, Hanamir decides to skulk on the outskirts of the town and see what he sees, while the rest of us pretend to be Pelor devotees on a tour of prominent temples to the god of light.

Inside the temple, there are three people wearing robes having a conversation. They seem surprised to see us, but greet us politely.

"What brings you all to our quiet little town?" says one of them, a human. 

"We're on a continent-wide tour of Pelor temples," says Galadriel. "And we couldn't pass up the town named for Pelor himself."

"Which others have you been to?" asks the human, who introduces himself as Karr.

"Oh, we're early on our journey. We started out from Aberith, which of course has its famous Temple of Light. Beautiful institution. And Peloria was next on our list!"

"We are honored to have you at our humble temple," says an elf, who introduces himself as Devin. "I'm sure it doesn't compare to the wondrous one of Aberith, but you'll find that a temple is not the bricks that build it but the souls that reside within it. Perhaps it is late in the day for us to give you a tour, but we could find places for you to stay the night and show you everything tomorrow."

"It wouldn't be too much trouble?" says Galadriel. "We're adventurers, so we're plenty comfortable camping."

"Oh, no, it would be an honor," says Karr. "Why don't you go out and wander the town while we secure some lodging for you?"

"Of course," says Galadriel. "Oh, and... how rude of me, I didn't introduce myself. My name is Galadriel, and these are my companions, Chunk, Tannin, Fibsy, and [Harlan](/characters/harlan/). I heard you are Devin and Karr, and... I didn't catch your name." She looks at the elf woman who hasn't spoken up.

"My name is Transa," says the woman. She walks off without another word.

"One more thing," Galadriel addresses Karr. "We would like to offer some gold in exchange for the lodging and the favor, but we stopped by the general store and were told that you have your own form of currency. How might I exchange some gold for some of the local coins?"

"Ah, well, a tribute to the temple would be most appreciated," says Karr. "Our people do not touch the sinful metals. But an offering to the well in gold is appropriate."

Galadriel tips her bag of sins and lets five gold fall into the well. Karr coughs a bit. She dumps some more sin until the total is around 20 gold.

Meanwhile, Hanamir explores the outskirts of Peloria. Not *everyone* runs away when they spot him, but some do. He sees some residents of Peloria returning to town from the direction of the forest. It seems that they've been foraging and hunting. One of them has a small hare, another has a basket of medicinal herbs. These people aren't traveling together. They each individually dig small holes and bury their goods, and place a stone marker on top of them. 

"Hmm," says Hanamir to himself. "I think I will break into the temple tonight."
