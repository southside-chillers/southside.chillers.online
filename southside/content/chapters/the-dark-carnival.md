It’ll take a week, Goldpeak says, to plan the gala. 

“Can it be carnival-themed?” [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) asks breathlessly. “Otherwise, don’t you think the clowns might show up… you know… not dressed as clowns?”

There’s some debate on this point, as the clowns have shown no signs of shyness about presenting themselves as such in public places before. And, [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) notes, won’t it be difficult to tell who’s a *clown* clown, and who is just a person dressed as a clown for a carnival-themed art gala?

But Galadriel’s enthusiasm eventually overshadows these salient points, and Goldpeak assures them that the invitations will be extremely clear regarding the theme and dress code.

“In the meantime, I’d encourage you all to familiarize yourselves with some basic art etiquette. For example, absolutely no touching of the artwork—”

“Thanks, Goldcliff!” says [Tannin](/characters/tannin/), clapping him hard on the back.

“Goldpeak,” says Goldpeak. “And I actually prefer being called by my first name, Easton.”

“Haha, whatever!” says Tannin. He gives Goldpeak a noogie.

[Chunk](/characters/chunk/) volunteers to bury the dead clown body.

“Oh, yeah, I got it,” he assures the party cheerfully. “Critters’ll die back on the farm, and we’ll bury ‘em, and life’ll go on.”

He hoists the Bag of Holding over one high blue shoulder and wanders toward the western gate of Aberith. 

“Where will you go?” asks Harlan.

“A nice, peaceful place back near home. I think he’ll like it. I figure he’s a green clown, so he must have a connection to the natural world, like me,” Chunk muses.

“Yes, well, uh,” says Harlan, “well, that’s a big help. Thank you, Chunk. You know where to find us when you’re done.”

The other adventurers spend their week pursuing various interests around the city. [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) goes to the quiet neighborhood of Gillyheart to check after [Redyl](/characters/redyl/), but the gnome is nowhere to be found at the address he left.

“Redyl? He left the city a couple weeks back,” says a neighbor. “Went home to the mountains.”

“He’s hoping his kids’ll be there,” says a gnome woman—Redyl’s cousin—holding her conical yellow hat in her hands and wringing it mournfully. “He hasn’t given up on seeing them again.”

“Nor should he,” says Hanamir, offering a reassuring smile. “If you’re in touch with him, please send him my best.”

“I will, large sir,” says the gnome woman.

Galadriel returns for a one-off gig at the Black Unicorn and asks around for helpful information about the art trade in Aberith. 

“Art?” snorts Slurpt Gearix, goblin proprietor at the Unicorn. “Didn’t take you for a fancy lady, Ms. Moonwater.”

“It’s a new interest of mine,” Galadriel says, with a sassy shrug. “Anyway, if I were a wealthy art collector, what names might I know?”

“Svannhug Veldie, for one,” says Slurpt. “Sold a few counterfeit Veldies in my day. Very easy to fake, and the buyers love to brag that they have one at home.” He scratches his chin. “And then there’s Asbestos. Sculptor, no last name. Does weird stuff with trash from old abandoned buildings, sells it for outrageous sums of gold.”

“Perfect, thank you,” says Galadriel. 

Harlan decides now is the time to set Tord up with a job and a home, if he’s amenable to it. 

“But it’s not in Aberith,” he explains to the former drifter. “Is that all right? It’s out in the country a ways. You’d be helping our friend maintain a lovely estate called [Shinebright](/characters/shinebright/) Tower—chores around the grounds, housework, caring for the sheep. We’d pay you, and you can live there.”

“What’s this other guy like?” asks Tord.

“He’s...” Harlan thinks for a moment. “He’s a craft brewing enthusiast.”

“I’m in,” says Tord.

With that, Harlan sends him to Shinebright’s tower with a stipend and a sealed letter for H’Jun, asking for Tord to be trained in the upkeep of the rental property. He feels some wordless satisfaction watching Tord leave the city. If he had to describe it, it would be the warm feeling that accompanies the understanding that he is a job creator.

“Let’s see what’s going on down at the disaster site,” he says aloud to Zotz. He pats the giant bat on its flank and hops astride its back. “Maybe there are some clues we missed before.”

Flying over the city, it’s clear that the crater in the Flats hasn’t seen much of a rebuilding effort yet. The dark circle cuts a clean line through the neighborhood, and the visual from above is as stunning as it is tragic. Its edges are notably empty of pedestrians, as if the populace has decided that coming close to the site of the unexplained calamity might cause further destruction. 

He returns to the Half-Full Flagon that night, silently hoping that the rest of the party has found other things to do. He’s in luck on that front—everyone’s away, and his favorite chair by the window of their suite is all his. From its concealed holster under one arm, Harlan procures the quiznos.

*Could something this small really have caused the explosion?* he thinks. He lets its power blossom in his hand. Being attuned to the rusty old dagger is like being able to see a bright light around it, though the sensation isn’t visual. He knows, without question, that if he were to direct the quiznos to do so, it would banish someone or something to another plane. And there’s more, too… there’s a power beyond that bright light, something dark glowing on the inside, but he can’t quite feel it, not enough to understand what it might do.

He puts it away just as Tannin bounds through the doorway and tosses two heavy bags filled with what sounds like coins on the floor in the center of the room.

“Check it out!” he says. He rummages in a pocket and pulls out an itemized list, written in Hanamir’s neat script. “Hanamir gave me an estimate of what all our treasure was worth, and I went to the marketplace and sold it. All of it!” 

“Wow,” says Harlan, actually impressed. “All in one day?”

“Yeah, I’m pretty good at convincing people that they want the things I’m selling,” he smirks. “The only thing I couldn’t sell was that flask of weird goop from the oni chamber. Remember?”

“I remember,” says Harlan. “It touched my hand and spread up my entire arm.”

“Yeah, that was the only thing I could say about it, so nobody wanted it,” says Tannin, shrugging. 

“We should really get a potions expert to take a look at it,” says Harlan. “I do want to know what it would’ve done to me.”

Hanamir, upon returning later that evening, suggests a service known as SideQuest Diagnostics. The results come back in less than a week, and he unfurls the parchment with interest.

“The enclosed substance will slowly coat whatever it touches until the object is fully sealed inside. This will result in death, should the object be a creature that relies on access to air for respiration,” Hanamir reads. “The time required for complete suffocation will depend on body size and time exposed. It can be dispersed with water. For use against a medium-sized foe, approximately three fatal servings remain. Yours sincerely, SideQuest Diagnostics.”

“Wow, dude,” says Tannin. “You live here?”

Goldpeak leads them around a spacious ballroom, where several cloth-covered paintings are being wheeled in on carts by servants in gold velvet livery. 

“Actually, no,” says Goldpeak. “This is the lesser of my family’s properties in Aberith. We mainly use it for hosting events such as these.” He pauses in front of a large canvas in the process of being unveiled. “Actually, I think the religious pieces ought to be displayed together, don’t you? Just to provide a narrative structure to the space?” The servant nods and begins wheeling the painting toward the opposite end of the ballroom. “Thank you, yes, over there is perfect.” 

“So, you’re certain the clowns will be coming tonight?” Harlan asks. 

“I did let them know some art collector friends would be in attendance, some of whom may be interested in their operation,” Goldpeak says. “My contact seemed quite interested. I’ll be grateful to you all if you can rid me of this entanglement, so long as you *please* take care not to do any damage to the artwork tonight.”

“We will treat your collection with the utmost respect,” says Hanamir, with a soft reverence he usually reserves for the missing Drephis State library books. 

“Yes, we’ll fit right in with your other guests,” says Galadriel. She has prepared a detailed fake identity for the night’s festivities, and is already sashaying around the ballroom looking very pleased with herself. “By the way, you can call me Gaia von Hastings. I’m a wealthy heiress from Threene, and I’m here to admire some *art*.” She whips out a peacock-feather fan and drops it on the floor. “Dang, let me try that again.”

“Maybe don’t try too hard tonight, hmm?” says Harlan. He wears a more dressed-up version of the disguise he wore to interrogate the dead clown. The makeup is better this time, at the very least. “Also, what’s your tie-in to the carnival theme? At least the rest of us tried.”

He points to Chunk, whose rubber clown mask is dead-eyed and horrifying, and to Hanamir’s minimalist mime face paint. Tannin is nearly bursting out of an ill-fitting purple suit with a zebra print lapel. He wears a matching top hat and holds a stick painted like a baton. 

“I’m a ring leader,” he explains, without anyone asking.

“We don’t have to pretend to be rich folks, do we?” asks Chunk, his drawl slightly muffled behind his mask. “We’re just pretending to be security guards? I think I’ll give myself away if anyone hears me talk.”

“Yes, only Galadriel and I are posing as guests,” says Harlan. “The rest of you need to watch the room and keep an eye on anyone who looks suspicious.”

“And for your information, Harlan, I’m dressed as a trapeze artist,” says Galadriel, indicating her heavily beaded, sequined, and fringed silver gown. “A trapeze artist who knows how to dress up nicely for a formal occasion.”

As a plum-colored dusk falls over Aberith, guests begin to arrive in pairs and small groups until the ballroom is thronging with the upper crust. The downside of the carnival theme is immediately apparent—as Harlan had predicted, there are a lot of clowns in attendance.

“Let’s each take a position at a different wall,” says Hanamir to his fellow security guards, Chunk and Tannin, “and determine which clowns are behaving unusually, if any.”

Having cast Disguise Self to appear as an older woman with white-streaked raven hair, Galadriel is embracing her role a bit too conspicuously (if her fellow adventurers could offer just one critique). 

“Gaia von Hastings, it’s a pleasure to meet you,” she murmurs, holding out a gloved hand for anyone and everyone to kiss. “Yes, Gaia von Hastings, of the Threene von Hastings. Charmed, I’m sure. Easton’s outdone himself tonight, I really must tell you! Have you tried the canapés?”

But she makes fast friends with a married human couple from Thorndale—idiots, she concludes quickly—and makes the rounds with them through the ballroom, stopping to comment on every piece on display.

“Now this one is positively *exquisite*,” she gasps, fanning herself, her grip on the peacock feathers quite steely this time. She casts a gooey, longing look at the painting. “Is this a true Veldie? I’ve wanted one *desperately* for so long…”

“Oh, Gaia, you must have it,” says her new best friend, Typhany, while Typhany’s husband, Bradwicke, nods authoritatively. “You ought to make Easton an offer!”

“I really must,” Galadriel sighs, as if resigned to her noble fate. She calls out across the ballroom toward Goldpeak, who chats with a couple of fashionable drow and a handsome human. “Easton! How much for the Veldie?”

“Sorry Tourmaline, Ishmael, Yddris—” Goldpeak gives them an apologetic look and shuffles toward Galadriel. “Madam, I’m afraid the Veldie is not for sale.”

“Ah, but every man has his price!” Galadriel teases. Her voice rises notably in volume and in pitch. “What might I offer you, from my *vast* and *nearly unlimited* fortune, that you would part with this stunning piece?”

From the back wall, Hanamir spots a clown in red and blue makeup and robes who is hanging on Galadriel’s every word. He treads softly toward Tannin, who patrols the adjacent wall.

“Eyes on red and blue,” Hanamir murmurs to him, when within earshot. “Those were the colors [Pouru](/characters/pouru/) mentioned her clown contact wore, yes?”

“Sounds right,” says Tannin. “I’ve been watching Harlan with purple and green over there. A lady clown.”

Harlan, carrying two flutes of champagne, has sidled up to the purple and green clown woman. He offers one to her, nodding his head back toward Galadriel and her ostentatious bid.

“What a spectacle! The nouveau riche will buy anything, but they can’t buy class,” he mutters, chuckling. “Argentum Blunderbuss. Pleased to meet you.”

“Lady Platernia,” says the woman. She smiles winsomely at him. “It’s nice to meet you, too, Mr. Blunderbuss. I take it you’re no great fan of modern art?”

“Just skeptical of the longevity of some of these trendier names, that’s all,” says Harlan. “Do you collect art yourself?”

“My parents did,” says Platernia. She makes a startling amount of eye contact with him. “Since their passing, I’ve discovered it’s not really for me. Managing the estate is quite enough as it is.”

“And yet here you are at an art gala,” says Harlan.

“Of course!” says Platernia, with a giggle that might be insincere. “Where else is a single heiress like me supposed to meet eligible bachelors of my own social station?”

Harlan blushes a little, but is unconvinced that she’s really interested in flirting with him. *Maybe this is a ruse to recruit new members to the AML*, he thinks. 

“I have a few acquaintances I should greet before I have any more to drink,” says Harlan. “But I’d like to join you for another round later. Will you be staying long?”

“I’ll be around,” says Platernia, her expression cooling a bit. “I guess we’ll see.”

As Harlan disappears into the crowd, Hanamir realizes Tannin is no longer beside him. He swirls in place, scanning the room for a dwarf in a purple top hat, before realizing he’s actually just behind him.

“Check this out,” whispers Tannin. He holds a large, gem-encrusted golden egg under one arm, barely concealed by his jacket.

“Did you steal that?!” says Hanamir, eyes bulging.

“Yeah,” says Tannin. “I figure if we need to, we can plant it on one of the clowns and blame them for stealing it.”

“Tannin, the plan was to lure them in with a ruse about funding for their mission.” 

“Yeah, but what if that doesn’t work?” Tannin shrugs. He frowns, clearly disappointed by Hanamir’s reaction. “Hey, whatever, man, I thought it was a cool idea. I couldn’t believe nobody was keeping an eye on these eggs. There are a couple of them over that way. I just… took one.”

“Our job right now is to keep an eye on the *clowns*,” says Hanamir sternly. “See what Chunk’s doing? Tailing that black and white clown? Do that, but for the red and blue one who’s making moves toward Galadriel.”

Chunk has indeed positioned himself against one wall next to a sullen clown in black and white robes, who is notable for his lack of attention to anything at all. The clown seems dead set on staring at the floor, enjoying neither canapés nor champagne, and certainly none of the art. Chunk inches closer to him and clears his throat.

“I hate these things,” he says. “How’d you get roped into this?”

The black and white clown glances at him and grunts. It’s more acknowledgement than Chunk had really expected, and he feels encouraged. A few seconds later, the clown speaks.

“Yeah. I hate these things too.”

“Art, right? What’s it even for?” says Chunk, piling on. “It just sits there.”

The black and white clown looks up, seeming to notice the art for the first time. His eyes dart from person to person, looking slightly nervous when they land on the red and blue clown and the purple-clad dwarf who is now addressing him.

“You’ll keep your distance from the lady,” Tannin says to the red and blue clown. “Unless you want trouble.”

“I’d like to talk to the lady, actually,” says the red and blue clown.

Tannin turns to look at Galadriel, who has arranged her Disguised face in an expression of devil-may-care nonchalance. She nods at him.

“All right,” says Tannin. “Why don’t we chat outside in the garden?”

“Perfect,” says the clown.

The three of them attempt to make their way subtly out of the crowd of art enthusiasts toward a wide glass doorway leading out to a beautifully-manicured garden.

“Hello,” says the clown. “I’d like to speak with you, preferably without your little friend present.”

“My bodyguard will remain close by, but our conversation can be private,” says Galadriel. “What, may I ask, is your reason for interrupting my evening?”

“Mr. Goldpeak, our mutual friend, was sadly unable to help me with a business opportunity,” says the clown. His eyes have a mischievous glint to them that puts Galadriel on edge. “And upon observing you tonight, I think perhaps you will be able to help.”

“And what kind of opportunity is that?” says Galadriel. 

“Might I be so bold as to take your hand?” asks the clown. He takes a small metal rod with a forked end from a pocket in his robe.

“I…” Galadriel starts, and hesitates, recognizing this as a tuning fork—an item Redyl was forced to use to plane shift orcs through the Shadowfell into the City of the Dead.

“I have something to show you. Something we’ve been working on for a long time,” says the clown.

“I'm sure I don't know what you mean,” says Galadriel. Her Gaia von Hastings voice falters. She steels herself, and then, in a moment of panicked bravado, grabs his hand.

With a sensation like being flattened into a sheet and rolled through a pasta maker, the two of them disappear from existence and reappear somewhere else. 

Galadriel’s stomach heaves as she regains a sense of where she is. She and the clown stand on the balcony of a tall tower, overlooking a barren hillside filled with terrible, unrecognizable creatures. They stand in formation, like an army, stretching out as far as she can see. The clown smiles down at her, his yellowed grin full of contempt.

“Ever since you took [Kandir](/characters/kandir/)’s bird, we’ve been watching you,” he says. “And we wanted to show you what we’re bringing.”
