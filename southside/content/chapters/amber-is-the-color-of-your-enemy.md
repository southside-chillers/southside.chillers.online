[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) has always been quiet, and that fact never fails to surprise people. At first glance, all anyone sees is “half-orc”—and the reality of mixed orc parentage is typically met with either disgust or pity. Regardless, before he says a word, he’s assumed to be violent. Troubled. Aggressive.

He learned long ago that the best defense against this assumption is to be the very quietest one; he must carry himself with the lightest step and the gentlest demeanor. It helps set people at ease. Even the students and faculty at Drephis State, who are proud of their worldliness, need to be reassured that the half-orc librarian won’t rip their throats out if they return a book past its due date. And sometimes, Hanamir thinks, it’s easiest if they just don’t notice he’s there at all.

In the past, he would make a game of re-shelving books without drawing the attention of a nearby student. How close could he get? How silently could he wedge an eight-pound copy of *The Encyclopedia of Medical Magic, 5th Edition* between two other books? Could a broad, tall, prominently-fanged individual such as Hanamir stand in such stillness that he could blend into a wall?

And ever since he began adventuring with this crew, that practice has served him well. 

Today, Hanamir walks unnoticed into a heavily-armed compound patrolled day and night by trained guards, and it’s as easy as breathing. He sneaks past the cellblock where his friends are locked up, and none of them see him. *Good*, he thinks. He passes the store room, where he spots [Harlan](/characters/harlan/)’s maul and [Tannin](/characters/tannin/)’s trident, among other weapons, piled in a corner. There are racks of uniforms hanging on the back wall. *Good*, he thinks. 

Down another corridor, he hears voices. They’re discussing politics.

“All I’m saying is that it’s a shame about Nyanceth. He served the city admirably, and it stings to see him pushed aside.” There are murmurs of agreement and scoffs of disdain. “Aberith’s military was his life’s work. He’ll always be one of us. And I just don’t feel that way about Pouru yet.”

“Hey, speaking of Pouru,” says another voice. “I just got orders that we’re supposed to transfer the prisoners to a ship.” 

“What?”

“Yeah, see for yourself. Supposed to bring them to the docks immediately.”

“Wait, but… we’ve never—”

“I’m not gonna be the one to say no to the general,” says the voice who received the order. “If that’s what you want to do, be my guest.”

Hanamir tiptoes away, silent as a cloud. Prisoners transferred to a ship? *Not good at all*, he thinks. There’s nothing for it: it’s time for him to spring them out of jail. He slips back to the store room and snags four uniforms in measurements he hopes will be roughly appropriate for his variously-sized friends. They’re the plain variety, not the amber robes of the special force that appears to handle magic-related issues. But he’ll take what he can get.

He materializes at the cellblock, and holds a finger to his lips before Tannin can voice his excitement to see him. He begins picking the locks, making quick work of them all. He tosses a uniform to each of them. [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/), Tannin, [Hermione](/characters/hermione/), and Harlan quickly don the robes and exit their cells, mimicking Hanamir’s stealth as closely as they can. 

Once they are out of the cellblock, they creep down the hallway to the room where the guards are still discussing the order to move the prisoners. 

“I have an idea,” Galadriel whispers. 

The other adventurers watch as she casts a spell on herself. It’s another new one, and it’s immediately clear to them that it was not quite successful. She does shrink down several inches and bulk up considerably, but the edges of her resulting form look slightly blurred. Her guard’s robes morph into a discount Halloween facsimile of an Aberith general’s uniform. Her hair fades to iron gray and ties itself up into a tight bun—but whenever she moves, they can see a flicker of her actual face behind the uncanny mask-like one she has conjured.

Nevertheless, she marches into the room where the guards are congregated.

“Change of plans,” she says gruffly. “I need you to release the tiefling immediately.”

A few of the guards jump at the sight of her.

“General… Pouru?” one of them asks, squinting.

“Yes,” says Galadriel. “It’s me, the general.” She clears her throat in a way she hopes sounds authoritative. “There’s no time to explain. We’re letting the tiefling go.”

One guard gets up close to her and peers directly into her eyes.

“How’d this prisoner get out of her cell?” he asks. He grabs her by the wrist.

“How dare you!” Galadriel wriggles but can’t pull away. “I am the general! Unhand me!”

The guard seizes her other wrist and swiftly pulls both arms behind her back. 

“Enough,” he says. “We know you’re the half-elf prisoner. But if you don’t like the cellblock, we can always take you to solitary.”

He leads her out of the room and back into the corridor, which he now finds filled with a heavy black smoke. 

“Whoa!”

Hanamir’s fist appears out of the haze and connects with the guard’s jaw. The guard momentarily loses his grip on Galadriel. She takes her chance to flee into the dark hallway. 

Another guard pops out into the hallway to back up his friend and is immediately hit in the face with a splash of water from Tannin’s flask. As he sputters and spits, Tannin freezes the water on his face. His eyelids are frozen shut and his nose and mouth are covered in icicles.

“It’s *ice* to meet you!” says Tannin. He chuckles at his own pun while the ice-faced guard punches himself in the mouth to break a hole in the ice that is large enough to breathe through.

Hermione doesn’t wait for another guard to leave the room. She shoots Magic Missiles directly inside, not entirely able to aim at anyone in particular through the smoke. She hears the sound of at least one missile hitting someone. And then another guard—maybe the one who had originally detained Galadriel, but maybe someone entirely new—gets a punch in the gut from Harlan.

“All right!” one of them bellows. “Look, we’re just the night shift. This isn’t worth it. Just… go.”

Hanamir re-corks his smoke bottle and the black fog begins to dissipate. 

“Where were you ordered to take the prisoners?” he asks. “On what ship?”

“I don’t even know. Just take the order.” The guard hands him a piece of parchment with the general’s seal and signature.

The adventurers waste no time running back toward the store room. They grab their weapons from the pile in the corner.

“Is that really all they’ve confiscated?” wonders Harlan. “I’d expect more than just our things and that bag in the middle of the floor.”

“That’s not just a bag!” says Hermione, kneeling down beside it. “I think this is a Bag of Holding!”

“Wow,” says Tannin. “I’ve always wanted one of these. Bag of Holding, I request all the gold you have inside!”

From the opening of the bag, five gold pieces spring out like jumping beans. Tannin dives down to the floor for each of them.

“Awesome,” he concludes.

Galadriel slings the Bag of Holding over one shoulder and looks anxiously back at the corridor.

“We should go. We can check out what else is in here later.”

Hanamir casts Pass Without Trace on the party, and suddenly, they all feel much quieter and quicker than usual. When they have escaped the Barracks and walked far enough that they feel safe speaking, they huddle.

“We should go talk to Slee, right?” whispers Galadriel. “He needs to know about this secret order to ship us off.”

“I don’t know how all five of us are going to make it to the king’s chambers at this time of night,” says Harlan. “Maybe we should split up.”

“I’ll go with Galadriel to see the king,” says Hanamir. “Where will you go?”

Harlan turns to Hermione and Tannin. 

“Maybe to the Minister of the Sea—remember, he’s the father of the priestess who gave me my hand back. That’s a connection I can use to get us access,” says Harlan. 

“What was their name again? Niacin?” asks Hermione.

“Nyanceth,” says Hanamir. “And that reminds me. I heard some guards talking about him earlier. They were saying he’d been pushed aside from his post as Minister of War, and one of them wasn’t happy about it.”

“Deru did say her father wasn’t what he used to be,” recalls Harlan. “Just old age, or something more sinister, I wonder?”

“Time to find out,” Tannin says. “Meet back at the library tomorrow morning?”

“Plan,” says Hanamir.

---

Halon Nyanceth lives in a stately house not far from his daughter’s temple. A garden, lush but overgrown, leads to a wide, lantern-lit porch with two uniformed guards on either side of the front door. 

“Halt,” says one of the guards as Harlan, Tannin, and Hermione make their approach. “What is your business at the Minister’s home at such an hour?”

“I know this is unorthodox,” Harlan begins. He adjusts his Kord medallion so that the guards can see he’s a respectable man of faith. “We have just witnessed something truly disturbing that requires the Minister’s immediate attention.”

“Something... related to the sea? To Aberith’s coast?” asks the other guard.

“Not quite, but it involves infighting amongst the council,” says Harlan.

“Ha!” says the first guard. “The council? Infighting? You bring no news at all.”

“We wouldn’t be here if we had any other options,” says Harlan in the most solemn and foreboding tone of voice he has in him.

“If you must,” says the second guard. He checks a timepiece on his wrist. “The Minister is still awake, but not for long.”

Harlan leads Hermione and Tannin into the mansion as the guards hold open the doors. The interior is elegant, though in need of a thorough dusting. They see an old man with a tuft of white hair sipping a cup of tea, sitting in an armchair by the embers of a fire. He wears a fluffy red bathrobe and a pair of well-worn slippers.

“Oh! Hello,” he says. He places his teacup down on a saucer and looks at them searchingly.

“Minister Nyanceth,” says Harlan, bowing. “Thank you for seeing us at such a late hour. Allow us to introduce ourselves—I am Harlan Stormborne, cleric of Kord. Your daughter Deru healed me of a missing hand by the grace of the Lord of Storms.” 

“Ah, yes! Deru is a good girl,” says the Minister.

“This is Tannin McBitters, a valorous warrior with a connection to the sea,” says Harlan. Tannin takes an elaborate bow and makes the Minister’s tea levitate in a spiral formation before settling back into the cup, unspilled. He waits for a reaction, but the Minister does not notice.

“And this is Hermione Daydark, an esteemed scholar of magical creatures,” says Harlan. Hermione curtsies. Her nose twitches at the dust in the air, but she catches herself before she can succumb to the kind of chain reaction of sneezes she experienced in the warehouse.

“Of course, of course, I remember you, Harlan,” says Nyanceth. “How have things been?”

“Troubling, Minister,” says Harlan. “Between the disappearances in Aberith and our own quest for justice, there is much worry clouding our minds at this time.”

“Ah, clouds, clouds, yes… very cloudy… Kord be praised,” says the Minister. Harlan nods at him, but glances nervously at Hermione and Tannin.

“Yes, you see, we recently arrived in the city with the goal of apprehending a suspect in a murder.”

Nyanceth’s eyes go wide. His heavily-wrinkled face grows somehow even craggier.

“The victim was King Slee’s friend, and he trusted us with this task,” Harlan continues.

“King Slee… yes, good king…” murmurs Nyanceth.

“We were able to meet with him briefly, but his Minister of Trade shooed us out the door before long.”

“Oh yes, of course, Ultas is a dear friend,” says Nyanceth, returning to a tone of mellow confusion. “Should I call for him? He helps me often.”

“No, no, that won’t be necessary,” says Harlan. He assesses the old man, who looks close to falling asleep in his chair. “Are you feeling all right, sir?”

“Nothing to worry about, my boy,” says Nyanceth. “I am not the warrior I once was, but I feel just fine. Now—you mentioned a murderer?”

“Yes,” says Harlan. “Someone murdered a dear friend of ours, and a friend of the king. His name was Bryn Starloft. We are dedicated to finding out what happened.”

“Bryn…” Nyanceth’s eyes glaze over. “Was he in the Royal Guard?” Harlan shakes his head, but Nyanceth is not paying much attention. “We ought to take this to Ultas. He’d know what to do. Unless your friend is in the sea!”

Harlan and Hermione exchange frowns. Tannin has completely zoned out, staring at the last cracklings of the fireplace. 

“Just a little morbid humor, my boy.” Nyanceth lets out a rattling chuckle. “My apologies.”

“Sir,” Harlan clears his throat and changes the subject. “Didn’t you once head a different Ministry?”

“Of course, yes, yes, but war is a young man’s game,” says Nyanceth airily. “Now that woman, I forget her name sometimes, she’s younger than I was, but she’s in charge of it now. And she fights, and I admire that, even as it frustrates Ultas!” He laughs that same rattling laugh. “And of course, he is my friend and I take his side, but I do like her spirit.”

Hermione gives Harlan a significant look. They both notice it: he’s more lucid when reminded of his old work.

“Unfortunately, sir, we believe she is usurping the authority of the king,” says Harlan. “And this is why we have come seeking your aid.”

“Terrible, terrible,” says Nyanceth, snapping back to his previous distance. “Just what Ultas always rails against… the king loses too much power to the council.”

“Do you truly believe in Minister Kandir? He seemed not to take our concerns seriously when we met him.”

“He is a busy man,” says Nyanceth. “When he’s not working at his office, he’s working on those books of his, and perhaps he misunderstood you.” He scratches his head and yawns. “He trusts and respects me, and that’s why he’s helped me stay on the council this long.” He yawns again, even longer this time, looking just about ready to call it a night. “Nobody hates Pouru more than he does. And he’s right, he must be right, of course.”

A sharp knock at the door jolts them all out of their reverie. A messenger of the King’s Guard peeks his head inside. 

“A message from the king for you, Minister,” says the messenger. He holds out a written note, but Nyanceth makes no moves to retrieve it. Hermione accepts it instead. “He has summoned the council to the chambers first thing in the morning. He noted that he’d like you to bring your guests.” He glances at the three strangers, bows, and leaves. The door shuts with a soft click.

“My guests?” repeats Nyanceth, mystified. “Oh! It seems our wise and noble king was already aware you would be here.”

“Our friends may have let him know,” says Harlan. “And sir, I hate to be any further bother, but could we crash here tonight? On a couch, or—anywhere, really? Our inn is across the city, and we’d hate to be late to this meeting in the morning.”

“My dear boy, this house is much too large for me now that I’m here all alone,” says Nyanceth. He laughs, but the adventurers feel sad. “There is plenty of room for all of you. Please make yourselves at home.”

The old man shuffles off to his bedroom, sniffing and sipping his cup of tea. 

The adventurers hear his door close with a decisive thud. Tannin exhales.

“Wow, I hated that,” he notes.

Harlan and Hermione tiptoe around the parlor, studying Nyanceth’s possessions. Harlan notices several Kordic artifacts, along with a few Pelor relics, perhaps gifts from his daughter or other religious figures around the city. Hermione stares up at an oil painting of a much younger Nyanceth, sitting alongside a prim and noble woman who must have been his wife, and an adolescent version of his daughter Deru, the priestess.

“I still can’t tell,” whispers Hermione. “Do you think he’s ensorcelled, or just old?”

“It’s time to check for sure,” says Harlan. He silently casts Detect Magic, but the musty old sitting room reveals no enchantments; none are in the hallway leading to the Minister’s room, either.

“Just old, then,” says Tannin. He beckons them to follow him down the corridor. He gasps theatrically at each open doorway. “Guys. These rooms are cluuuuuuuutch.” 

Hermione peeks into a bedroom decked in old-fashioned but undeniably luxurious furnishings. “Wow,” she says. She puts down her bags and gives the bed a test bounce. Softer than a hay-stuffed pallet in a tavern, and softer still than a bedroll on rocky ground. She smiles.

“Dibs on this one!” says Tannin, diving into a four-poster bed in a room at the end of the hall. It is large enough to accommodate a bugbear. His satchel lands in the corner of the room and his trident clatters to the floor. Still swaddled in his guard disguise, he falls into a swift and fervent sleep.

Harlan opens the door to a room that his heart tells him once belonged to Deru. The curtains are silver and multilayered, like a sky heavy with stormclouds. His new left hand brushes against the bedspread, softer than a snowdrift. Somehow, the texture feels familiar. He falls into an uneasy sleep.

Galadriel and Hanamir sneak through patches of darkness on the streets between the Barracks and the palace. It’s much too late for them to try for an audience with the king the old-fashioned way, so without discussion, they agree to rely on their combined powers of stealth and deception.

It is, in fact, criminally easy to get in. Galadriel spider-climbs the wall outside the palace and lowers a rope for Hanamir to climb. Upon arriving at the other side, she decides to try out her Disguise Self spell again to adopt the form of one of the palace servants. She checks her reflection in a puddle. A convincingly weathered human woman’s face stares back. 

“Oi, gov’na!” she whispers, testing out her voice. “Blimey, innit?”

“Disappearing now, but following you,” says Hanamir. Galadriel looks around, but he has already vanished. 

She sees an abandoned bucket with a rag by a drain. Seems like a good prop. She hoists it in the crook of one arm and knocks authoritatively on the closest door. A scrawny young man opens it a crack.

“Lemme in, then,” whispers Galadriel. “I’m on chamber pot duty tonight.”

“Doesn’t that usually happen in the morning?” says the boy.

“Course it does!” says Galadriel. “But ‘is ‘ighness’s tummy’s not been feeling so well today, so some extra rounds’ve been deemed necessary, if you know what I m—”

“All right, all right,” he says. He ushers her inside. “Please do not tell me any more.”

She tries out a saucy grin on her new face and hoists the bucket so that it rests on her hip. 

“Come on, then, lad! Off with you, and don’t tell no one you saw me out there, neither, or I’ll ‘ave you signed up for ‘is Majesty’s next round of irritable bowel syndrome!”

The boy grimaces and runs away. Galadriel struts, very satisfied with herself, down the gilded corridor toward the king’s chambers. Upon hearing the bedpan story, the guards outside his suite let her pass without challenge.

King Slee sits at his desk, poring over a pile of documents. He startles at Galadriel’s entrance, but his expression softens when she abandons her disguise. She lowers her head and all but kneels before him.

“Your Highness,” she says. “I am terribly sorry to interrupt you in your private quarters like this. But there is grave news concerning your Minister of War that you must hear.”

King Slee glances back at the papers on his desk and clucks his tongue.

“What has the general gotten herself into now?” he sighs.

Galadriel stands and passes him the order to transport the prisoners to the shipyard.

“We found Bryn’s murderer. It was the individual we suspected, a tiefling named Magic,” she says. “We secured a confession from her, but we were arrested by the Amber Guard when we tried explaining her circumstances. She’s under the influence of some very powerful magic and is not in her right mind. The general then separated us from her and gave this order to have us removed.”

She feels as if she has set down a great burden when all of this is said. King Slee is frozen in shock.

“Bryn’s murderer, caught here? And I wasn’t informed immediately by the guard?”

“Indeed, sir. It seemed the general was interested in keeping this information from you.”

“And this order...” He inspects the parchment Galadriel handed him. “To transport you all out of the city before I would learn of it?!”

She bows her head. The king takes a few moments to collect his thoughts before continuing.

“The general is headstrong. She is younger than most who have held the post, and she’s had her fair share of scraps. But I’ve never had reason to doubt her loyalty,” he says. “This is incredibly distressing news.” He closes his eyes. “This tiefling, Bryn’s murderer? They still have her in custody?”

At this moment, Hanamir emerges from a shadow by the door.

“As of an hour ago, yes, sir,” he says.

Slee jumps in his chair. 

“I didn’t see you there,” he says, a bit sharply.

“Sorry about that, sir,” says Hanamir, smiling slightly. “Light on my feet, as you know.”

King Slee shakes it off and clears his throat.

“I wish to see that tiefling brought to justice, and not rushed out of town. The Minister of Justice should be involved here, although her ways are a bit soft for my liking.”

“We’re glad you agree,” says Galadriel. “What can we do to help?”

“I will demand that the tiefling be brought before the full council tomorrow,” says Slee. “And I’ll arrange for you to stay in guest quarters here. First thing tomorrow we’ll discuss this with the full council present. I don’t think Pouru is so bold as to move the prisoner after this order goes out. She may backpedal her attempted treachery, but we’ll ensure she answers for that just the same.”

“Thank you, your highness,” says Galadriel, bowing again. “We are so relieved to hear this, both for Magic’s sake and our own.”

“Kandir was right,” sighs the king, almost inaudibly. “The bickering on the council has gone too far.”

“Kandir, sir? That’s the Minister of Trade we met, right?”

“Indeed,” says Slee. “He has suggested that the reforms that created the council perhaps went too far to dilute my power. A noble man, Ultas Kandir, who would give up his own power for the betterment of the country.”

“He may have a point,” says Galadriel, with a glance at Hanamir, who nods, sagely. “Well, we cannot thank you enough for your intervention in this matter. We will gladly go now to wherever you’d like us to stay until we can reconvene on this tomorrow. One last request—could you make sure that the Minister of the Sea brings our friends with him to the council meeting? When we parted, they were headed to speak with him.” 

“Yes, all of you who were witnesses to the tiefling’s confession would be welcome. I will send word to Nyanceth to include them.”

The king jots down a note, marking it with his seal. He opens his door and hands it to the guards outside, and then instructs them to escort Galadriel and Hanamir to the guest chambers.

The guest chambers at Aberith’s royal palace are, it turns out, sick as hell. In fact, they’re more like a separate resort compound within the palace. There are multiple bedrooms, sitting rooms, dining rooms, and balconies. As soon as the guards leave, the two adventurers high five each other (“To diplomacy!”) and gravitate toward the selection of beautifully-packaged snacks in the main parlor.

“Owlbear jerky, candied giant scorpion bites, and BBQ fire beetles,” says Hanamir. “Want any?”

Galadriel grabs a packet of the BBQ fire beetles and starts funnelling them into her mouth. Hanamir goes to town on some owlbear jerky.

“You know,” he says between effortful chews, “my backup plan was to smash the window, grab you and throw you onto the exterior wall, while I plummet three stories, relying on Slow Fall to avoid death. But your way was better.”

“Ha!” says Galadriel, spewing some BBQ fire beetle onto the carpet. “Well, I’m not convinced we can trust Pouru to stay on the up-and-up regarding Magic tonight. If she’s gone in the morning, I’ll have a hard time forgiving myself.” She peers around a corner into what turns out to be a decked-out spa room. “But these accommodations are something special.”

Hanamir smiles, then gnaws off another piece of jerky. 

“Well, goodnight,” he says, and wanders off to seek a meditation spot. As if out of habit, he disappears.
