# Plan pitches

The party joins [Chunk](/characters/chunk/) in the guardians' quarters after his conversation with [Thelatha](/characters/thelatha/). 

[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) pitches an idea: “So we wrap [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) in a robe and present him to the people. 'The king has returned!'”

- Will this be believable? What did the king look like?

**[Galadriel**](/characters/galadriel/): We say, "The king’s back! He went on a really long walk… in the ocean. He came back with a trident… and… he’s younger?"

**Chunk:** "We have disguises! We could make it work."

**Tannin:** "I’m not saying no, I’m saying my deception is really bad."

**Hanamir:** "Yes, but the people here are all hopped up on goofballs. By the way, we shouldn’t eat the food here. I bought a bunch of rations in Aberith that we should eat instead."

- The party does not agree to this, though there are some noncommittal grunts.


**Galadriel** continues: "So the problem is that the city is stuck in the Feywild, because the king has the coin and he’s been M.I.A. for twenty years."

**Hanamir:** "But time passes differently here, yes? So how do they measure twenty years?"

**Chunk:** "Thelatha suggested time isn’t passing in the usual way, but they record seconds and minutes and hours like we do in the material plane. It’s just always the same time of day. They have hourglass type things for practical purposes, but the sun doesn’t move."

- We note that legends we’ve heard of the Feywild are somewhat different from what we’re experiencing. There are a lot of contradictory legends, even, so it would be impossible for all of them to be true.

# Setting out from the city

Thelatha is excited about the party going to find the King, but cagey about the location of the coin. Hanamir tricks her into revealing more information.

**Hanamir**: “So, how long do we have before you flip the coin?"

Flustered, she admits she has the coin herself.

### Preparation

- We get rations, supplies, healing potions, and two dubious unidentified potions.  [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) determines they are transmutation potions—one purple, one green.

- We see the king’s notes. Much is written about the titans: large (18 ft?) humanoids who have attacked the city in the past. These attacks have been reason for the city to shift planes before.

- The king was obsessed with preventing future titan attacks because he wanted the city to stay in the Feywild, believing it to be the best of the three possible locations.

- The overall population is divided on whether Feywild or Material plane is better for the city.

- Using a strange map from the king’s notes (an axis of “time of day” and an axis of “distance from city” with various markings for encounters with titans), we decide to head out in search of him.

### Execution

- We go east first, and after eight hours of walking, the sun sets by about 1-3 hours.

- We then go north (?) and Chunk, leading the way, isn’t sure that we’re not going in circles; the sky doesn’t change and it’s very difficult to tell how far we’ve gone.

- Tannin roasts a chicken-sized frog or something for dinner.

# Gilbert Finley

We find some running water—partly flowing one direction, partly another. Extends in both directions as far as we can see, and we're unable see the other side from the riverbank. Scouting from the air atop Zotz, Harlan still can’t tell how big this river is.

Tannin uses a combination of his Trident of Fish Command and his Speak With Animals ritual to command some river creatures to speak with him. He addresses a large fish with a bioluminescent dangling thing. At first, he just hears the fish SCREAMING.

**Tannin:** Fish! What’s wrong?!

**Fish:** Nothing’s wrong! We’re just excited!

**Tannin:** About what?

**Fish:** Food!

**Tannin:** Ah, you’re hungry! What do you like to eat?

**Fish:** Worms!

**Tannin:** Aha, have I got a deal for you. I can get you some worms. But I need to know what you know about this river. How far does it go? How many days of swimming to get ot the other side?

**Fish:** Thousands of me. 

- This roughly calculates to a mile.

Apropos of nothing, Chunk volunteers to turn himself into a fish for the other fish to eat. This is #dark. 

Tannin describes the Titans to the fish.

**Tannin:** Have you seen anything like that? Which direction?

**Fish:** Yeah. Big guys! Not like you. Big guys!

- Tannin does not translate this for the rest of the party.

**Fish:** They eat fish. They’ve eaten my friends.

**Tannin:** We don’t like them either. Where are they?

**Fish:** There’s a camp of them nearby. I swim by it every couple times I go around.

**Tannin:** So if we follow this river in the direction we’re heading now, will we get to it?

**Fish:** Yeah. The camp. 4 of them. This way.

**Tannin:** What’s your name?

**Fish:** Gilbert Finley.

- We thank him and dump a cup of ramen noodles into the river. 
- As he swims away, the fish says one more thing.

**Fish:** You know, there are things that eat the big guys, too…

# Abandoned encampment

We follow the coastline west and get back to about 7 pm by the sun. The river starts to turn back and head toward the east. 

We come upon a little outpost: a camp that looks to have been used in the last week or so, though we're not sure how things weather here. It seems to have been occupied by three individuals, and at least one of these creatures was a dwarf. They were headed in the same direction as us, along the river (west). There are no books left behind, just an abandoned camp. 

We’re able to sleep, but it’s somewhat restless—and maybe we’re not getting as much restoration from it as we would expect. 

We theorize that this camp may have belonged to the king, or one of the guardiants tracking him.

Hanamir is the only one being picky about the Feywild rations. Everyone else is eating weird bugs and creatures we hunt for. Galadriel claims Feywild food is juicier and more flavorful. Chunk is particularly good at hunting and foraging, and procures:

- a gummy stag
- gummy rabbits
- vines with jelly beans growing off of them
- root vegetables that taste like full-on s'mores

# The Meanlock

Galadriel casts Leomund’s Tiny Hut to protect the party for a long rest. As we are setting up camp, we hear a snickering from somewhere nearby. Hanamir shadowsteps into the surrounding brush and actually bumps into its source. It’s a little creature, sort of terrifying looking, and it stares up at the group, laughing. Chunk identifies it as a meanlock.

Hanamir tackles it, and pins it easily. The meanlock communicates to him telepathically.

**Meanlock:** Let me go!

**Hanamir:** What’s so funny, brother? 

**Meanlock:** Hungry!

**Hanamir:** Whatcha trying to eat?

**Meanlock:** Dwarves!

Hanamir communicates this knowledge and the party deliberates. 

- Harlan asks if we kill it. 
- Chunk is in favor, as it wants to eat Tannin.
- Tannin is enthusiastically in favor.
- Galadriel would be willing to try getting more information out of it first.

The only other information Hanamir can glean from the meanlock, however, is the word "fear," associated with the nearby river.

- Harlan interprets this to mean there is a big creature in the river that is a predator of not only titans and fish, but of meanlocks (or other land creatures that stray too close to the riverbanks).
- Tannin demands the meanlock be chucked in the river.
- Hanamir complies, and the party sees an enormous tentacle pull the meanlock underwater.

# Titans in sight

We rest in the Tiny Hut. Halfway through the evening, while Harlan is on watch, we see some torches approaching from the north. Harlan wakes everyone up. Hanamir shadowsteps away, while everyone else remains in the hut. After about 20 or so minutes, the torches stop moving, about 300-400 feet away. We can hear them setting up their own camp.

These are indeed titans—a pair of them, one younger and one older. They have some gummy creatures they’re about to roast. They speak Giant. Chunk understands them, and translates some of their conversation. There is a third in their party who is expected to be back soon. 

They set up camp at a safe distance from the riverbank, being cautious... because they are aware of the thing in the water. They refer to it using a word that sounds like "kraken."
