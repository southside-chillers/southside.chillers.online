[Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) is tuning her lute. She looks up.

“Oh! Lolth’s legs!” 

You intuit that this is a new exclamation of surprise that she’s trying out. 

“Didn’t see you there. Yes, please, come in. Pour yourself a tankard of Fleck’s finest Eillin ale.” 

She takes a sip.

“Folks, I’m glad you turned up just now. It has been COUGHcough weeks since the last time I recounted our tale. But I think it’s time, don’t you? Pull up a chair. I invite you to come with me on a journey of danger and delights—and reminisce with me on some of the more recent highlights of our quest.”

She conjures a wavy flashback border before your eyes and begins to strum her lute.

“Who could forget where we left off? Surely not I!” She thinks for a long moment. “Oh, yup. We were in the Tower of Lolth…”

---

The wavy flashback border expands, and within it you see [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/), [Harlan](/characters/harlan/), [Tannin](/characters/tannin/), and Galadriel in the dining hall, each inspecting their new treasures. Tannin puts on his sick new chunky gold chain necklace and brandishes his trident. Harlan stares sullenly at his burlap sack full of copper pieces. The smell of that exquisite pot roast is in the air.  

“Hello?” comes a voice from down the hall. 

Our heroes spring into pantomime. Hanamir disappears behind the treasure room door. Harlan and Tannin pretend to be shackled together, while Galadriel, still dressed in drow robes, pushes them ahead of her as if she has just captured them. They confront two guards in the hallway.

“What’s going on here?” one of them, dressed in leather studded armor, asks.

“I found these two miscreants desecrating our temple. I am taking them to the arena to face justice,” says Galadriel, using her best “stern priestess” voice.

“Nice. Can we watch?” asks the other one.

“Uh, yes,” says Galadriel. “It’ll be really gross. You’ll love it.”

“Cool,” says the armored guard. “Where’s Drada?”

“Oh, she’s fine,” says Galadriel. “She… went out to run an errand.” 

Somehow, the guards buy this.

“Let’s bring the other prisoners, too,” one of them suggests.

“Yes! The more the merrier. I mean, the more the bloodier,” says Galadriel, chuckling. “Lolth will be pleased with this tribute.” 

When the guards turn away to unlock the prisoners’ room, Galadriel signals to Harlan and Tannin that it’s time to attack. Hanamir emerges from his hiding place as if materializing out of the ether. 

---

The wavy flashback border around this scene grows thicker and hazier before your eyes. You can see Galadriel in the present again, and she smiles, though a tinge of pain is in her eyes.

“Ah, a great battle! And a terrible one,” she sighs. “It was in this confrontation that our dwarven friend, Tannin, fell unconscious. And...we didn’t get a chance to speak to him after that.” 

She gazes at the floor, maybe feeling a little guilty. 

“We spared one of the guards. I took his super sweet leather studded armor for myself, and he gave us information about the rest of the tower in exchange for his life. He told us that there’s a floor of eternal darkness above us, and a prayer room above that, which can only be accessed by manipulating the lights in other levels of the tower. And he let us know that the priestess who got away probably just made herself invisible.”

Galadriel plays a minor chord on the lute.

“But when we finished fleecing this jabroni, we saw that Tannin had disappeared. There was an empty vial of Magic’s plane-shifting potion lying on the floor where he had been.”

She raises her tankard of Fleck’s Eillin ale in a toast. 

“To Tannin! A loyal friend and fearsome barbarian. Wherever he is, may he be doing what he loves: holding dominion over all marine life, and flying into a destructive rage whenever necessary.”

She drinks deeply, then gestures back at the original flashback window. 

“After that, we spoke to the three prisoners who had been locked away by the fiendish followers of Lolth.” 

“We met Tallis, Feld, and Hillbloo. They seemed nice. We learned that Feld is the cousin of H’Jun, the drunkard from Eillin. He has a lot of heart, but he’s not a very good bard. We let them go on their way, and decided to search the tower for anything we’d missed.”

---

In the flashback portal, you then see the adventurers roaming through the tower, looking for clues in the places they’d fought through. They find a key fashioned of bone underneath the bed of one of the guards they killed. Hanamir finds a red garnet orb in a statue of a bugbear on the wall of the arena where they fought the Wyrmling. He also suffers intense chills from the white pearl orb he is holding. They extinguish the torches in the lower floors of the tower, following the instructions of the guard whose life they spared. They continue on to the Eternal Darkness floor and start following a murky maze.

---

“Oh, and here’s one of my favorite parts!” Galadriel grins.

---

You watch as Hanamir tosses Galadriel into the impenetrable blackness alongside the path. Galadriel lets out a victorious ululation when she lands, unharmed, on the wall, and climbs up to the ceiling to survey the maze from above. She guides them safely to the other side, and an entire booby-trapped level of dangerous gameplay is skipped entirely.

“Next we take a long rest, so I’m going to fast-forward through that part.” With a wave of her hand, the flashback portal zips through several hours of footage in which the trio struggle to get comfortable on the icy floors of the Lolth tower. “Now, okay, we’re about to enter the Prayer Room, which is this asterisk-shaped room where each point is a hallway ending with a statue of a god.”

You see Harlan approach the statue of the Troglodyte god with the jade orb. He communes with the god, who asks for his orb back in exchange for some information. Harlan demurs, and consults with the party. 

All the gods seem to be evil-aligned. The party decides to have Galadriel talk with the shark god, who at least is lawful evil. She returns with some fairly banal advice, which is that there are eight gods in the room, and that they must find them all to do what they seek. So, they need to find all the orbs.

You watch as they search the tower a second time. They return to the arena and retrieve the body of the Wyrmling. It’s a grisly scene as they hack the corpse apart searching for the final orb to complete their collection, and they don’t even find anything except a deeper sense of shame.

When they finally make their way to the floor with all the bedrooms, they find a secret compartment that is unlocked by the bone key they found earlier. Harlan looks inside and finds the last orb, belonging to a fire giant god. 

They return to the prayer room. The Troglodyte god is angry with Harlan.

“I’m tired of waiting,” he says, invading Harlan’s mind with a voice like ancient stone. “You said we could make a deal.” 

“What can you give us that will help us save the moon?” says the cleric.

“I am the God of Hunger. I will give you this satchel. Each day, you may take food from this satchel, and it will heal you of your wounds.”

Harlan takes it, and places the jade orb in the mouth of the Troglodyte statue. It disappears.

---

The flashback portal fades from sharp color to hazy desaturation, and Galadriel waves it away. 

“A dangerous trade? Who can say?” she shrugs. “Join me after these messages for the next chapter of our adventure. Until then, I will be here, knitting a sweater for my adorable best friend, Buddy the Pig.”

At the sound of his name, Buddy waddles over to Galadriel from another room. She scoops him up and sets him in her lap, and he proceeds to lick her face.

---

Commercial break. Two goblins in ill-fitting suits address the camera.

“You got potions? We buy potions.”

“You got cursed amulets? We love cursed amulets.”

“Don’t want to deal with the hassle of an arcane inheritance? We will take that mess off your hands, no questions asked.”

“Good credit, bad credit, bad credit from another dimension, we don’t care. We will make you a deal that will leave you saying: ‘Look at this cool stuff I bought.’”

“Just ask for Sanford & Son. Buyers and sellers of the most fascinating antiques, collectibles, and magical artifacts on the continent.”

“Sanford & Son: If you need to find us, we’ll probably be somewhere.”
