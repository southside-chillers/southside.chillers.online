“Welcome back, General,” says [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/). “We know there’s not much time. Is there anything you can tell us now that you couldn’t before? Something that might exonerate you, or shed light on the true nature of your crimes?”

“I don’t think you’ll be able to save me,” says [Pouru](/characters/pouru/) wryly, “but I’ll tell you anything you want to know.”

“First of all, who did this to you?” asks [Harlan](/characters/harlan/).

“It all started when I fell in with the AML,” says Pouru. “The Anti-Magic League, if you’re not familiar. I know you’re from out of town.”

“We know of them,” says [Hermione](/characters/hermione/). “They were the ones who pressured the council for the ban on magical items, right?”

“Yes,” says Pouru. “And I agreed with them.” She exhales in a short almost-laugh. “Still do. Even if one of them used magic to control me.”

“Do you know who it was?” asks [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/).

“I didn’t witness the spell being cast, but I have a guess,” says Pouru. “Looking back, it feels as though after my first meeting with Number Six, my actions were not my own.”

The adventurers wait, in silence, for her to continue.

“He was only ever called Number Six. He wore blue and red face paint and a long, flowing robe. The getup looked ceremonial, almost, but I never asked what it was for. He would visit me at my home late at night to give me instructions.”

“Hold up, face paint?” says [Tannin](/characters/tannin/). “Like… a clown?”

“Or a court jester of some kind, yes,” says Pouru.

“Okay, we’ve seen a clown,” says Harlan. “He walked into the Outcast to meet Tord after the explosion, and immediately walked out, looked spooked, and [Chunk](/characters/chunk/) followed him to the Upstanding Gentleman—”

“Explosion?” interrupts Pouru. 

“Oh no,” says Hermione. “Have you not heard? Something terrible happened earlier tonight. An explosion in the Flats.”

“What?!” says Pouru. Her eyes are wide. “Was this magical in nature? How many casualties?”

“Difficult to say,” says Hanamir, “but it destroyed roughly ten percent of Aberith. It was catastrophic. The city outside is, to put it bluntly, in chaos as we speak.”

Pouru is silent for awhile, blinking rapidly, as if suppressing tears. 

“What with our clown sighting just hours later… would the AML target that area of the city, do you think?” says Harlan.

“No!” says Pouru, shaking her head. “No, their largest base of support is from the Flats. No. Never.” She swallows. “Ten percent of the city… it’s unfathomable.” 

“We followed some people fleeing the scene, and one of them led us to that bar Harlan mentioned, the Outcast,” says Chunk, almost inaudibly at first, but gaining confidence. “And that’s where we saw the clown. Do you think he may have been involved with the explosion, perhaps separately from the Anti-Magic League?”

“I don’t know. It may have been someone imitating him, or just a coincidence that he walked in at that time. I didn’t know him. We only ever spoke about AML business.”

“I have a question,” says Galadriel. “You joined the AML willingly, you said, so what’s behind that decision? Why outlaw magic? Did you have a traumatic experience, or something?”

“Governing a city is difficult,” says Pouru. “Governing a city where some civilians can wield unchecked, often unstable power is… well, it’s just not sustainable.” She sighs. “The Amber Guard was put together awhile back to try and combat some of the larger threats posed by magic use in Aberith. I disagreed with that decision. It seemed like a move in the wrong direction. Why recruit these people, and in doing so, encourage this behavior?”

“So you were openly in support of this anti-magic organization while being the highest-ranking person in Aberith’s military, which includes the Amber Guard?” asks Hanamir.

“Not openly,” she says, her eyes downcast. “I hid my identity. These meetings were held in taverns, mostly, without much fanfare. Off-the-cuff speeches by concerned citizens. I didn’t agree with everything I heard. But I was glad to see that others agreed that magic was a bigger threat to civilized society than was being appreciated in a legal capacity.”

“Ah,” says Hanamir, locking eyes with Pouru.

“Yes, as a member of the king’s council, it was inappropriate for me to be attending these meetings in secret,” she says. “Even more inexcusable to be receiving instructions from a political operative in my home. I committed these crimes knowing they were treason. And here I am.”

She casts some glances around her cell, filthy and unkempt. 

“Does the AML have a connection to a person known as the Messenger, who preaches against the gods?” asks Hermione. “His message has an anti-magic bent to it, if I remember correctly.”

“None that I know of,” says Pouru. “The Messenger and his followers are very secretive, but the AML is a recognized political group within the city. They post fliers for their meetings. I’m sure you’ve seen them. They’re all over the… the Flats…”

Her voice grows quiet.

“What about those secret voyages to the Northern Ruins?” asks Harlan. “The ones in the middle of the night? You were questioned about them at your trial. Were you really shipping off the disappeared people?”

“No, those had nothing to do with the disappearances,” says Pouru. “The goal of those voyages was to procure some very dangerous relics from the Ruins. Only one of these voyages was successful, in fact. Most of them just resulted in dead soldiers.”

“Would you mind telling us about the successful voyage? What was procured?” asks Hanamir.

“It was a transmutation stone,” says Pouru, “found on a dead body.”

“And what were you going to do with these artifacts?” asks Hermione.

“I don’t know. Once it was recovered, it was the AML’s concern,” says Pouru.

“Do you think they were going to try and destroy the relics?” asks Galadriel. “Do you think one of them might have caused the explosion tonight?”

“I would hope they would be destroyed, lest something like this explosion happen,” says Pouru. “But I don’t know.”

“As you said, someone in the group is clearly comfortable using magic to achieve their ends,” says Galadriel. “Otherwise you wouldn’t have been ensorcelled.”

“Yes,” says Pouru. “And?”

“Just seems hypocritical,” Galadriel shrugs. “The whole ‘master’s tools cannot dismantle the master’s house’ thing and all that.”

“Perhaps.”

“Do you think [Kandir](/characters/kandir/) knew you were involved with the AML?” Galadriel asks. “We saw his—I mean, we know he was looking into the group.”

“If he was aware of my involvement, he never made it known,” says Pouru.

“What did he say when he visited you in prison?” asks Hanamir. “Last time, you couldn’t remember.”

Pouru is quiet again for a long time, her eyes scanning a patch of floor. 

“I still can’t remember,” she says. “But… he wasn’t alone. I remember that much.”

The adventurers wait. Pouru’s mouth hangs open in confusion.

“It doesn’t make any sense, but I think he came with Six,” she says.

“Why doesn’t that make sense?” asks Harlan.

“It doesn’t seem right,” she says. “Like… something’s been changed about the memory.”

“Is it more Kandir or Six that feels wrong?” asks Hanamir.

“Well,” says Pouru. “I don’t think I’d be able to tell, except that under normal circumstances, I have a hard time believing someone dressed like Number Six would be allowed through security.”

“Kandir’s crooked, obviously,” murmurs Galadriel. “This, and the letter we found? He’s accepting payoffs from someone, and then using that money to pay for alliances and his fancy bathroom.”

“Fancy bathroom?” says Pouru.

“Don’t worry about it,” says Galadriel.

“Ah, speaking of payoffs,” says Hanamir, “what do you know of Mr. Odo?”

“Oh,” says Pouru. “Yes, Odo is well-known to the authorities. Relatively low-level. He operates a substantial amount of the smuggling into the city. We tend to look the other way.”

“Why?”

“The devil you know,” smiles Pouru. “He knows how to run a criminal enterprise. He knows the people you need to know to be left alone.”

“So, he knows you?” says Galadriel.

“I never had any personal involvement,” says Pouru.

“But you got the payoffs?” says Harlan. “And Kandir? [Mirama](/characters/mirama/)?”

“No, it’s a little bit below our paygrade,” says Pouru. “A customs guard might take a payoff. Are we aware of it? Yes. But at the same time, does this larger network sometimes provide useful information to the crown? Yes. Sometimes we’re tipped off to something important, because sometimes those accommodating customs officials hear when something is coming into town that is of interest. It’s not the highest concern of the council.”

“What about tentacle-faced people?” asks Hanamir.

“Excuse me?”

“Have your customs officials ever tipped you off to their arrival in Aberith?” 

“There have been rumors,” says Pouru. “But not much more than that. I don’t understand why you ask.”

“Tell us those rumors!” says Galadriel.

“Well, I’m not as intolerant as some,” says Pouru, “but there are creatures that simply have no place in society. And occasionally there will be rumors that one of these creatures was spotted within city limits. We dispatch the Guard, and nothing ever comes of it. But yes, we get reports of all kinds of outlandish stuff. Kenku, and the like. People just like to tell stories.”

“What bad stuff do they do?”

“It’s hard to separate the rumors from the facts. People say they eat babies, commune with the dead… who knows if any of that is based in truth. I’ve never heard a *good* rumor about them, like ‘they’re great at painting’ or something, I’ll tell you that much,” says Pouru. 

“Well, thank you for your candor,” says Hanamir. “You have been a great help to us.”

“Yes, I don’t have much to lose, do I?” says Pouru. She sighs and leans against the wall of her cell. 

“Is there anything you would like us to do for you, short of breaking you out?” asks Hanamir. “Something for your legacy, or…?”

“Kind of you to ask,” says Pouru. “You all seem like complicated but hopefully good people operating outside the law, as I tried to do. You’ve done things that will land you here someday. So I don’t quite understand your motivation, apart from defending Aberith, as I also tried to do. I’ll say this: don’t focus on the small-time threats—Odo and whatnot. There’s a reason why those were not our primary concern.”

“I’m worried about the people going missing,” says Galadriel. “And the massive explosion that happened a few hours ago.”

“That’s the legacy that matters to me,” says Pouru. “This city. It’s why I fell in with the AML in the first place.”

“So you’d recommend we continue their mission? After all this, you still support them?”

“Yes,” says Pouru. “Do you think a maniac with a *shortsword* could kill ten percent of the city?”

“One last thing,” says Hanamir. “Do you think Mr. Odo and his organization have beef with the Messenger? Or the AML?”

“I really don’t get why Odo, and the Messenger, keep coming back in this conversation,” says Pouru. “Odo is nothing new, and the Messenger’s an extremist. Abolishing all gods?”

“Well, you want to abolish magic,” says Hermione.

“We’re not talking about abolishing magic from the wild,” says Pouru. “It can exist in nature. But it’s too dangerous in a civilization. Anyway, I’d certainly expect Odo and the AML to butt heads. I’m sure the ban has been a serious hindrance to his business.”

“Thank you, once again, general,” says Hanamir. He hands her his water skein and a set of rations through the bars of her cell. 

---

Out of earshot from the row of prison cells, the adventurers stand in the hallway and consider their options.

“We can use magic in here,” says Harlan. “The obelisks don’t seem to have an effect. I’d like to try using Remove Curse again, this time on Galadriel’s eyes.”

“Ugh, yes please,” says Galadriel. “I keep imagining all the ways [Cazna](/characters/cazna/) is going to use everything she’s seeing against us.”

They duck into a small alcove with some cleaning supplies stacked in the corner. Harlan closes his eyes and raises a hand, which begins to emit a faint silver light. He reaches over to lay his hand on Galadriel’s shoulder, and she shrugs it off.

“Hold still,” says Harlan. “You just saw me do this to Pouru—”

“Sorry,” says Galadriel. “Didn’t mean to do that. Just had a shiver go through me.”

Harlan reaches out to her again. This time, as soon as he touches her, she smacks him hard across the face.

“Hey!” says Harlan.

“Sorry!” says Galadriel. “That wasn’t—I didn’t do that!” She sputters. “It… it was the gauntlet!”

“Oh dang,” says Tannin. “The gauntlet is on Cazna’s side, huh?”

“Yes,” says Galadriel. “I can feel what it wants, and it’s… scary. It wants me to… rip Harlan’s hand off again.”

Chunk looks at them all in bewilderment, but he’s not about to ask for the backstory right now.

“All right, even *more* reason to get this curse off,” says Harlan. “Would two of you mind holding her arms back while I try this again?”

Hanamir and Tannin each take one of Galadriel’s arms. She bites her lip, looking unnerved.

“Okay, here we go again,” says Harlan. “One, two, three—”

He places a hand on Galadriel’s shoulder, and the silvery glow from his palm strengthens. Her face twists in what looks like disgust; she struggles against Hanamir and Tannin, but they are easily able to hold her in place. 

But as Harlan feels the spell emanate outward, he feels something pushing back against it with an alarming strength. The light in his hand flickers. 

“What is going on?!” he mutters, straining harder.

But the light then fades entirely, and it’s difficult for him to tell if what happens next is real or imagined. 

He sees spiders—thousands of wriggling legs and shining dark bodies—erupting from his hand. He tries to pull away, to shake them off, but they crawl up his wrist and upper arm. He starts to scream, but as the spiders reach his neck, he stops. He doesn’t want to scream anymore. He can hear the sound of laughter. Is it Galadriel? No. It’s… he doesn’t know how he knows this, but he knows… it’s Lolth. And her laughter is coming from his own mouth. 

And then, in another instant, the spiders are gone. He gasps. 

“Uh, Harlan?” says Tannin. “You okay?”

“No,” he says. “I think we’re going to need to talk to [Deru](/characters/deru/) about this.”
