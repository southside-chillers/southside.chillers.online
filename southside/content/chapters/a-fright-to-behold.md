[Odo](/characters/odo/) emerges from his mirror-lined hallway, still laughing at us. He takes awhile inspecting us with his many eyes; we feel unsettled and strange under his gaze. Finally, he addresses us.

**Odo:** Who speaks for you?

After some mild deliberation/bickering, we pick [Harlan](/characters/harlan/). Odo fixes his full, unnerving gaze at him.

**Odo:** I see. A former cleric of [Kord](/characters/kord/). But what are you now? 

**Harlan:** I serve a new god. But my change of religion is obviously not why I’m here. We each have something the other wants: we, as adventurers, have access to information and treasure from across the land. You, a well-connected member of the establishment here, have information and goods that we need. We are here to propose a trade, nothing more. We don’t want to disturb anyone's business. But we do have some important things to obtain.

Odo laughs to himself. 

**Odo:** You have something that I want? What could that be?

**Harlan:** You did of course hear of Easton [Goldpeak](/characters/goldpeak/)’s fall from grace. We have reason to believe there's more to that story, and we think it would be mutually beneficial if the true perpetrators of the crimes being pinned on him were brought to justice. Besides, Goldpeak was the major trafficker in magical items in this city, so obviously, if he can be brought down, no one is safe…

This gets a rise out of Odo. There’s a murmur in the room, like a widespread 'oh no he didn’t!'

Odo floats uncomfortably close to Harlan. Harlan stares right back into his largest eyeball, unflinching.

**Odo:** I think we both know that Goldpeak was not and is not running the show around here. After all, you didn’t go to him.

**Harlan:** Oh, we went to see him. He was one of our first stops. But his stature in this city has changed, as we all know. I wouldn’t call you a second choice, no, of course not, but...

[Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) pulls on his sleeve and hisses in his ear.

**Galadriel:** What are you doing???

Harlan whispers back, with a surprising level of self-assuredness. 

**Harlan:** Bullies don’t respond to cowards; they only respond to people who stand up to them. We gotta come in projecting strength. I’m confident we have something he wants.

He turns back to Odo.

**Harlan:** Perhaps we should retire to more private environs to discuss the terms of a trade. 

Odo gestures to two individuals: a dwarven woman, [Oreheart](/characters/oreheart/), and a drow male, [Kenoba](/characters/kenoba/). They lead the way into another room. He gestures with his tentacles for us to follow them. We sit down around a table.

**Harlan:** We are convinced Goldpeak is not the mastermind behind the explosion in the Flats. We won’t insult your intelligence; we know you know that too.

An unseen force shakes the table.

**Odo:** Enough about Goldpeak. I thought you were here to make a trade.

**Harlan:** As I said, the crime being pinned on him erroneously is against our interest. So our proposal is this: We have some magical items in our possession that you may be interested in. If you aren't, no harm done, and we’ll leave.

**Odo:** I’ll let you know if you’ll leave.

Harl gives a meaningful glance to his companions. [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) sizes up Oreheart and Kenoba. 

- Oreheart is looking hardy, but rather old for a dwarf. She has standard armor and an axe at her waist.
- Kenoba is a tall, slender drow. He has no visible weapons and wears a kimono-style robe. 
- Both are staying quiet—it seems like their role is just to observe. 
- They are standing in two corners of the room toward the back, behind Odo.

**Odo:** So what exactly are you offering? 

**Harlan:** I will defer to my quartermaster… 

He looks meaningfully at [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/), who perks up.

**Hanamir:** We can offer you a transmuter stone and an enchanted longsword of cold.

**Odo:** A transmuter stone and an enchanted longsword, hmm. 

He's not super impressed, but interested. He turns to Oreheart.

**Odo:** What do you think?

Oreheart replies to him in Undercommon, which Tannin understands. She's saying, “Moight be werth twenty plat'num.”

Odo considers this.

**Odo:** All right. Now, you don’t have these with you?

**Harlan:** We’ll arrange a trade-off.

**Odo:** And what is it that you ask for in exchange?

**Harlan:** All valuables have a price. In this case, we think it’s relatively minimal. We want to know what really happened with Goldpeak. We know you don’t like him—that’s not the point. The point is that he’s part of a much larger conspiracy that threatens not just us, not just Aberith, but everything. You know about the clowns, and I'm sure you've even dealt with them before. Surely you know how dangerous they’ve been. Our mission is not just for our own personal gain, but to protect the inhabitants of the city, the ones you rely on for your business.

**Odo:** You’re asking me to turn over information on a client, and there’s a reason that’s bad for business. So the cost is high to me, because it’s my reputation.

**Harlan:** Your reputation doesn't exist in a vacuum. If you protect those who wish to sow chaos, to upend business as usual and displace those in any kind of power… that is a much more existential threat to your business than you acknowledge, and certainly greater than the threat to your reputation.

Kenoba steps forward at the mention of 'protecting those who wish to sow chaos.'

**Kenoba:** How dare you speak to Odo like that? Odo immediately ceased all contact with the AML as soon as we understood what they did.

Odo gives Kenoba a glare. Kenoba leans far back into the shadows—seems like this outburst was a mistake. Odo turns back to us.

**Odo:** I apologize for my subordinate.

**Harlan:** Nothing to apologize for.

**Odo:** We did indeed stop working with the AML after the incident. We had nothing to do with the artifact they brought in. They did that themselves. 

**Harlan:** Which of the artifacts…?

**Odo:** You know the one. It destroyed a large part of the city.

**Harlan:** And what was that called, again?

**Odo:** It translates to 'Sky Arrow,' I believe. That is not the type of item that we sell.

**Harlan:** All right. We really just need to know what it was that Goldpeak sold to you.

**Odo:** I’ll give you the details of the transaction that you already have a receipt for, in exchange for the transmuter stone.

Hanamir leans forward to whisper to Harlan.

**Hanamir:** That might not be good enough. We don’t know how many transactions there have been.

**Harlan:** We need details on the entirety of your business relationship with Goldpeak.
 
**Odo:** For that, I’d need something of much greater value from you.

He turns to Tannin suddenly.

**Odo:** I’m told you have a talent for stealing eggs.

- How did Odo hear about that?? 
- Tannin muses that he may have heard about it from Tannin himself (he tends to brag about his exploits loudly when intoxicated).

**Tannin:** To be clear, I returned that egg. 

**Odo:** If you’re willing to test your skills, I need to find replacements for some pets I’ve recently lost. If you would be willing to fetch me some eggs… I could find a way to misplace my notes on Goldpeak.

**Tannin:** What type of eggs are we talking?

**Odo:** Manticore.

**Galadriel:** You kept manticores as pets? And lost them? What do you mean by that?

**Odo:** Sometimes people think the best way to get to me is through my pets.

**Galadriel:** How horrible.

**Odo:** Yes. Anyway, I had four manticores, and now I have only two. I would ask for you to procure me some manticore eggs—or young manticores, though eggs are best.

**Tannin:** That’s an option. We could do that. But… hear me out. Considering that the enemy of your enemy is your friend, is there any other alliance we could work out? We’re no friends of the AML either. Perhaps instead of sending us on a fetch quest for you, we could take out a mutual enemy, especially one that’s starting to move in on your territory, bringing in such powerful artifacts.

**Harlan:** The egg thief makes a good point.

**Odo:** I don’t think the AML is as big a threat to me as the council.

**Galadriel:** I don’t think the council has a problem with you at all. [Mirama](/characters/mirama/) has told us this—she considers the black market trade beneath her paygrade.

**Odo:** Mirama is a practitioner of justice, and I don’t feel an urgent need to replace her. She’s fine. Now the Minister of Trade, on the other hand…

**Galadriel:** We have reason to believe [Kandir](/characters/kandir/) and the AML might actually be the same thing. Or the AML and he are working in clsoe contact. So those enemies actually might be the same one.

**Odo:** Then kill Kandir.

**Tannin:** *(claps)* Done!

He looks around, ready to high five everyone, but is left hanging.

**Harlan:** Targeted assassination might draw some attention. You want him off your back, is that correct?

**Odo:** I want a seat on the council. Not for myself, of course. But for my interests.

**Tannin:** These eggs are starting to sound better, I guess.

**Harlan:** I think there’s an opportunity for a longer term relationship here. Perhaps if this trade goes well, we can discuss what further projects we might collaborate on together. Don’t want to close any doors. Let us get these eggs for you as a sign of good faith, and as proof that our groups can reasonably trade. And perhaps then we can discuss future dealings.

Odo gestures to Oreheart.

**Odo:** Very well. Oreheart will show you the way. Kenoba will stay behind.

He glares at Kenoba again. We are led out of the room by Oreheart.
