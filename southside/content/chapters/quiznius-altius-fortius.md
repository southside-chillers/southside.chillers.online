[Tannin](/characters/tannin/) walks over to the pillow on the end of one of the raised tombs and gives it a little fluff. 

“Go back to sleep now,” he says. “Sorry to wake you. We’re just passing through.”

The two figures are still coated in enough dust to lend a stony, ghostly cast to their skin. They do not react to Tannin’s reassurances, so he continues.

“I could tell you a bedtime story, if you want,” he says. “Or my bard friend here could play you a lullaby?”

The two figures confer with one another. Then the woman speaks.

“Perhaps for a gift, we’d be willing to let you pass.”

Tannin translates this to his friends. 

“You know, some people say my songs are a gift,” says [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/).

“I already offered that,” says Tannin. “I think they want actual treasure.”

“Some people say my *songs* are an actual treasure—”

“Let’s see if they want that cask of wine in the Bag of Holding,” says [Harlan](/characters/harlan/). “They already have goblets. They’re probably wine conoisseurs.”

“No! That’s special,” says Tannin quickly. “Mirama gave that to me for good luck. She told me to only open it when we’re on our way back.”

“Fine,” says Harlan. “Maybe we give them the turquoise we just found, then?”

Tannin summons the turquoise from the Bag of Holding and offers it to the dusty figures. The woman accepts it and shows it to the man. They seem satisfied. They walk to the stone table and pour some of the silver dust from the flask into each goblet. 

“Wait,” says Tannin. “Before you go to sleep again, can you tell us anything about where we are? We’re a little lost.”

“Where are you trying to go?” says the man.

“Out… generally… I guess,” says Tannin. He looks around, thinking quickly. “But also we’re just like, pilgrims, looking to pay tribute to historical relics. We’ve met the crab god, and that was really cool. Respectfully. Anything else of interest nearby?”

“You are in the lower chambers,” says the woman. “This temple is a three-tiered structure, and all paths lead upwards in the end. These lower layers serve primarily as tombs for great warriors laid to rest.” She gazes at Tannin, her eyelashes blinking dust. “Have you met Talakepapaklas?”

“Doesn’t ring a bell,” says Tannin.

“He was interred here,” she says. “You must heed the warning. Anything that desecrates his temple…”

“Oh, nope, that’s not us at all,” says Tannin, shaking his head. “We are not about desecration, not one bit.”

The two figures each sip from their goblets and lie back down on their tombs. 

“Why was he buried here?” asks Tannin, but they are fading fast.

“He was a great king…” says the man. 

Then they are silent and still, their chests not even rising to breathe.

“Well, team,” says [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/). “That went a lot better than I thought it would.”

The adventurers return to the chamber that they refer to as the Beetle Room. There are three exits they have not yet tried. One of them is a doorless hallway, long and L-shaped. It slopes upward, prompting a stream of excited babbling from Magic.

“It’ll be up higher, I’m sure of it!” she says. “The higher we go, the stronger it feels. I need you to unshackle me so that I can grab it when I see it—I know I’ll recognize it, not even by sight, but by the feeling in my *heart*—”

But soon the hallway is blocked by a massive boulder.

“Looks like sandstone,” says Tannin, patting it. “Doesn’t match the materials the rest of the tomb is built from.” 

“Unshackle me,” pleads Magic. “And let me blast through it. Please!”

“No matter how many times you ask, the answer is still going to be no,” says [Hermione](/characters/hermione/). “I’m not sure how else to communicate this to you.”

Tannin is now peeking around the boulder through a sliver of empty space between its edge and the wall. 

“I think this was pushed down here from higher up,” he says. “Looks like rollers behind it, like someone brought it here expressly to block others from coming up.”

“Does it swivel, like the wedge from before?” asks Galadriel.

Tannin pushes a shoulder against it and heaves.

“Nope,” he says.

“Let’s check one of the other hallways,” says Hanamir, ignoring loud protests from Magic.

The next hallway is a terrifying scene. Standing on ledges lining both walls are twelve withered corpses, unnaturally upright, six to a side. They obscure some glyphs carved into the walls behind them.

“Uhhhhhh,” says Hermione, hanging back and clutching Magic’s arm. “Do we even want to bother?”

“This does look like the other end of one of the hallways we saw earlier,” says Harlan. “It might only lead us back to where we’ve already been.”

“I’d like to see if Tannin can get a better look at the writing behind these guys,” says Hanamir. He prods one of the corpses with the pole. It creaks to life, moaning, which then wakes its eleven comrades. 

“Oh, twelve zombies, that’s exactly what we need right now!” Harlan shakes his head.

“Hey dead guys! Think fast!” Tannin shouts. He pops a bead off his fireball necklace and tosses it in the center of the cluster of undead. It explodes, reducing the zombies to dust and briefly setting Harlan’s eyebrows on fire. Tannin looks around at the group, beaming with pride.

“Kord Almighty!” Harlan yelps, slapping himself in the face to snuff out the embers. 

As he says this, the ceiling begins to shake again. A shower of rocks and debris knocks into each of them—there’s no dodging it. But the walls stay up. 

“All right, read the walls so we can get out of here,” says Harlan. 

“Oh,” says Tannin. “It’s just another warning about the many-eyed god... fiery death and all that.”
“Cool,” says Harlan.

In grumpy silence, the adventurers turn around and approach the last of their hallway options, which takes the form of a series of short staircases. The stairs, incidentally, lead up.

“Yes!” Magic breathes. “Up we go.”

Hanamir leads the way, poking at each stair with the pole. But, as with the very first trap they triggered in the hallway leading to the crab god, they do not hear the click of the pressure plate deploying until the combined weight of Hanamir and Harlan sets it off.

A massive stone sphere ejects from above them and crashes down the stairs. With the pole, Hanamir vaults over it. but it rolls directly onto Harlan and Galadriel, flattening them both. Tannin, Hermione, Magic, and Buddy are close enough to the bottom of the stairs to jump back into the Beetle Room and out of the way, just in time.

“Oh dang,” Tannin says, running back up the stairs to see Harlan and Galadriel’s unconscious and unsettlingly pancakey bodies. “Who’s got healing potions?” He pats his flask. “Oh! I do.” He pours a little potion into both mouths, and some color returns to their faces. “Want some bread, my dude?” Tannin asks Harlan as his eyes flicker open.

“As long as I don’t have to get it from that bag,” Harlan mumbles. 

“No worries, man,” says Tannin, passing him a piece. “Here you go.”  He breaks off another piece for Galadriel. They sit on the stairs for awhile, the bread gradually shuffling them back onto this mortal coil.

“Short rest?” says Galadriel. “If there are no more boulders coming down the stairs, anyway.”

“I think we’re in the clear,” says Hanamir.

The adventurers sit on the stairs for another hour, recuperating. Galadriel leans against the wall and pets Buddy, who sits on her lap.

FEELING BETTER? he asks.

*Somewhat. Nervous to fight anything else, though, until we’ve had a real rest.*

But within a few minutes, the adventurers gather their things and continue up the stairs. The yellowish haze in the air gets thicker the higher they climb. When the stairs give way to a broad landing, they open out into a spacious, vaulted hall dotted with stone statues of monkeys.

“Oh, ew,” Hermione says, glancing at the floor. There are roughly a dozen dead baboons strewn around beneath the statues in varying states of decay, and the smell is not great. “Looks like something has been eating pieces of these creatures and leaving the rest. I wonder if these were sacrifices.”

“Scorch marks on the walls, too,” says Harlan. “Maybe a baboon barbecue?”

“Shh,” says Hanamir, pointing to the end of the room. A spherical shape is floating in the air above one of the baboon corpses. It has a single eye and multiple tentacles, and it does not seem to have noticed the adventurers yet.

“Is that a Behol—” Tannin starts, but Harlan claps a hand over his mouth.

“I’m casting Pass Without Trace on us,” says Hanamir. He closes his eyes and generates a tiny translucent sphere in his hand, which grows until it envelops the adventurers. Inside the sphere, they creep forward, and realize that the sounds of their footsteps have been muted.

They walk slowly across the room, avoiding stepping in baboon remains along the way. And as they get closer to the floating sphere, they realize that it is actually made of wood, not flesh.

“Wait,” says Tannin. “So it’s not real… but it’s still floating… and taking giant bites out of the dead monkeys?”

They walk past it into the next hallway, staring in confusion. The wooden Beholder continues chowing down on its prey without acknowledging them, or indeed appearing to see them at all.

“Anybody itching to back there and figure that one out? No? Okay, good,” says Harlan. 

The passageway before them is decorated with carvings of people playing a ball game, each of them holding what looks like a woven basket on a stick. There is an inscription above them, which Tannin translates before anyone asks.

“‘Dare not open the pit unless ye be willing to meet the challenge,’” he reads. “Pit? What pit?”

Galadriel swats him on the arm.

“Don’t say that unless you want a pit to open underneath us, fool!” she says.

“The pit, I think, is down there,” says Hanamir. He points toward the end of the hall, where there is a round lid with a handle sticking out of the floor. On the wall above it, there’s an indentation that matches up with the playing court depicted in the carvings.

“Are we willing to meet the challenge?” Harlan asks. “Personally, I’m still not feeling my best after that boulder episode.”

“Agreed,” says Galadriel and Hermione, in unintentional unison. 

“Oh, I don’t know, what’s an ancient game going to do to us?” Hanamir chuckles, waltzing down the hallway. He’s already halfway toward the hatch. The others scramble after him. 

“Come on, really?” sighs Hermione. The prospect of keeping Magic calm during a sporting event feels overwhelmingly unattractive.

“Really!” says Hanamir. He pops open the hatch door and gazes down into the pit. “Some treasure down there, folks. Some dead people too. But mostly treasure.” He smiles a sassy open-mouthed smile at Galadriel. “Can I get some Mage Hand help here?”

“Fine,” says Galadriel. She summons the glowing hand and starts another round of the world’s most dangerous claw-grabber game. With her first attempt, she picks up a jade statuette.

“I think the ball that goes with the game is down there,” says Tannin, sounding more excited than the context calls for. “Oh! And now it’s floating! Probably because you touched the treasure.”

A heavy black ball rises from the opening in the floor and then drops at their feet. 

“I guess we’re doing this,” says Harlan with resignation. He reaches down and picks up the ball. 

Immediately, the ball zooms through the air down to the other side of the hallway, bounces off the wall, and rebounds back toward them. Magic crouches down and covers her ears, making an anxious noise that increases in volume with every second that passes.

“Missile snare! Harlan! The gloves! Put them on!” Hanamir urges as the ball smacks their side of the wall, close to the indentation. The adventurers all have a sinking feeling about what might happen if the ball is allowed to score a point. Harlan whips out the Gloves of Missile Snare. The ball is already rebounding back toward them when he succeeds in getting one onto his right hand. He holds it up, just as the ball whistles past his head, and the glove snaps his fingers around the projectile with unnatural speed.

“Got it! Got it!” he cries in disbelief. The ball is wriggling in his gloved hand with a surprising amount of force. “What now?!”

Hanamir picks up the Bag of Holding and opens it, lifting it up so that it rests behind Harlan’s hand.

“Let go!” says Hanamir.

The ball flies straight into the Bag of Holding. Hanamir shuts it and pushes it to the ground, just in case the bag starts flying too. It doesn’t. A grin spreads over his face, and it’s contagious. The adventurers can’t believe how clever that was.

“Amazing!” cries Tannin, leaping up and down. He claps both Harlan and Hanamir forcefully on the back. 

“Is the ball still alive in there?” Hermione wonders. They open the Bag of Holding. 

“Nope. Just a ball now,” says Harlan. 

“We should make up our own game with it!” says Tannin. “Let’s grab the rest of that treasure, though, huh?”

The pit contains several more jade statuettes as well as a spectacular golden chalice decked with amethysts. 

“Doesn’t seem to be magical, but it sure is pretty,” says Galadriel. It’s almost too heavy for her Mage Hand to lift. “Let’s drink that wine from Mirama out of this thing if we make it out of here.”

“*When* we make it out of here,” Tannin corrects her. “*When* we make it.”
