The next morning, the adventurers awaken in their beds at the inn to the sound of steady rain on the windows. Only a dull glow indicates that it’s time to get up, and Galadriel is still skeptical on that point when Harlan tries shaking her to consciousness.

"Come on," he says. "They’re reading Bryn’s will soon, and we don’t want to be late."

"I’ll skip it," she says, pulling her blankets over her head.

"No, you won’t," says Harlan, shaking her again.

On the other side of the room, Hanamir is whistling while he makes up his bed with a monk’s precision. Galadriel is only convinced to rise when Buddy nudges her with his li’l snout and offers some encouraging oinks. The party trudges toward the hill outside town in a chilly rain that makes each footfall heavy with mud.

Bryn’s observatory is no longer bustling with guards and investigators. Now, it is empty except for a small group of close associates gathered in the late scholar’s library. Fleck the bartender greets the adventurers as they enter and instructs them to set their horrendously dirty shoes by the door.

"I’ve been named the executor of Bryn’s estate, apparently," he explains, looking a little flustered. "I guess he must have done that before the incident with the—well, you remember—the coins." 

He holds up a roll of parchment that must be Bryn’s will. 

"I can’t read this, of course, and I was wondering if one of you might...?" 

He unrolls the parchment, upside-down, and thrusts it in what happens to be Harlan’s direction.

"Yes, certainly," Harlan says, taking it from him. "Not to worry."

Harlan adopts a dignified stance and walks to the front of the group gathered in the library.

"Friends of Bryn Starloft," he begins, "we are here today to read the last will and testament of an extraordinary person. Let us take this time to honor his passing." 

They all bow their heads for a moment of silence. H’Jun hiccups.

"Now, let’s see..." Harlan scans the parchment. "Bryn Starloft leaves his observatory to the town of Eillin, in the name of Mayor Frunk Thunderstruck. The mayor shall use his judgment on what to do with it—it may be made into a public space, or he may sell it to benefit the town in another way."

Frunk nods, and lowers his eyes contemplatively. Harlan continues reading.

"Bryn says his inventions, many of which are ‘dangerous or incomplete’, shall be destroyed."

"What?! No!" Galadriel gasps. Harlan gives her a stern look and reads on.

"His scrolls, he leaves to his wizard friend, Finethur Shinebright." Harlan pauses and feigns pondering. "Have I met him? Not sure."

"Yes, he was that sheep, from last time," says Hanamir, not getting it.

"Ah, yes," says Harlan.

Galadriel looks at both of them shiftily.

"Let’s keep reading," says Harlan. "Bryn leaves the top shelf of his book collection to Fleck, the most voracious reader he knows..." He clears his throat. "Fleck, we’ll get these into Braille for you, don’t worry. There’s gotta be a spell out there."

Fleck’s eyes and smile both gleam, and he gives a thumbs up.

"All books on animals go to Finethur Shinebright, to inspire him with his polymorphs. Yes, yes, he’ll certainly need those." 

Galadriel disguises a giggle as a sneeze.

"Books on various schools of magic should go to Ahmed Noke, Shinebright’s worthy apprentice. Also a very reasonable bequeathing. Bequeathal? Bequeathment? Yes." He clears his throat again. "I hear the young upstart loves magic. May he read these in good health."

Harlan takes a sip of something from his flask.

"Ahem. Books on religion should be left with that up-and-coming cleric of Kord who has recently passed through town." He pauses, smiling. "He must be talking about me!"

"Yes, we’ve set those aside for you already," says Frunk.

"And finally...the book beginning with the letter ‘V’ should be destroyed, immediately, before it falls into the wrong hands," he says slowly.

"Already taken care of," says Frunk. "We burned it along with the inventions, as he wished."

"Do we know why he thought this book might be dangerous?" asks Hanamir.

"No, we just followed his instructions. Bryn was a very learnèd man, and none of us could read the language this book was written in. Nothing we could even recognize," says Frunk.

"And one is missing, right? Stolen by the murderer?" says Galadriel. "How many does that leave?"

"Twenty-four, now, after destroying one and another being stolen," says Frunk.

Hanamir has been peering at the piles of books. 

"I think the missing book is about animals. According to the number of books he left Shinebright, there should be one more animal book than there is," Hanamir says. 

"Well, we can at least take what’s meant for Shinebright and Noke to the wizard’s tower," says Galadriel, winking obviously at Harlan, who turns pink and looks a little sweaty.

"So what now?" asks Harlan, too loudly. "What will happen to the town? And to the observatory?" 

"We’ll stay locked down until the threat has passed," says Frunk. "And, if you were to bring his murderer to justice, I’d say Bryn might want the observatory left in your capable hands. If not, perhaps we’ll turn it into a public library—a monument to his legacy, and a gift to the people of Eillin."

"A fitting tribute," says Harlan. "Say, can you enlighten us as to Bryn’s system? How did you know that one book in his collection was missing?"

"Bryn went through many books, never keeping more than 26 at a time in this particular bookshelf. If he got a new one he wanted to place there, he was adamant about removing another one first. We never quite understood why. The ‘V’ book must have been important if it made it into his group of 26."

"Why 26?" asks Hanamir. "One for each letter of the alphabet?"

"Let’s look at the titles," says Harlan. 

Sure enough, there is a book for every letter, except for ‘V’... and ‘D’. 

"Dragons!" says Galadriel abruptly. "The stolen book must be about dragons. An animal book that starts with a ‘D’? Come on!"

"Do we know anyone who might want to steal a book about dragons?" says Harlan.

"Yes," says Hanamir. "Remember the tiefling, Magic? The tiefling whose village, home, and family were burned to a crisp by a dragon?"

They each look at each other, stunned at how much sense this makes, and how quickly it came together.

The adventurers head back to town and stop by the market, which is crowded despite the foul weather. One drow has set up a stand selling enchanted umbrellas that repel water and envelop the user in a toasty warm glow. A family of half-elves is brewing hot chocolate, and the scent wafts throughout the market square. 

Hanamir fills in Harlan and Galadriel about the tracks he saw outside Bryn’s observatory.

"I was following some tracks north away from Bryn’s when you sent that bird to come and find me, Harlan," he explains. "I came as soon as I could, and we fought Guz and his goons, and we continued on to Shinebright’s tower. But I think those tracks might be our best lead if we want to find Magic—or whoever it was that killed Bryn."

"Yes, that sounds promising," says Harlan. "Is there anything we need to pick up here before we head that way?" He takes a brief look at a stall displaying some very cool hats. "I don’t think I need anything, but I would like to exchange my copper for some silver..."

He finds a money exchange stall and comes back with a small pouch of silver coins.

"I feel at least 80 pounds lighter!" he says, looking exhilarated.

"And you no longer jangle when you walk," says Galadriel. "Congratulations!"

Galadriel stops at a stall featuring black cloaks and fishnet stockings for humanoids of all heights, staffed by two very sad-looking drow women. She purchases a stick of heavy black eyeliner and immediately applies it, somewhat artlessly.

Hanamir finds a leatherworker and commissions a knife holster that can be concealed under one’s clothing. 

"It’ll be 20 gold, and you’ll have to pick it up tomorrow," says the craftsman. 

"It’s a deal, brother," says Hanamir.

"Shall we go find those tracks, then?" says Harlan, once Hanamir has worked out the particulars of his order.

"Let’s," says Hanamir. 

---

Hanamir leads them back out of town, past Bryn’s observatory, until he finds the remnants of the tracks that led him north toward the mountains. The rain has made them almost undetectable. They walk in silence, Hanamir leading the way, until they come to a circle of stones arranged around a rune etched in the ground.

"A teleportation circle," says Galadriel, touching the stones. "This location is linked to another one via this rune. Someone created a portal here and passed through it. And...it looks like they did it a little sloppily, like they were in a hurry."

"If only someone had been here to see them do it," says Harlan.

"Galadriel, could you use Speak With Animals, and see if a creature nearby saw something?" suggests Hanamir.

"Good idea!" she says. She looks around the area and sees a groundhog poking its head out of a little hole near the rune. A burst of magical energy shoots from her hands and makes the groundhog glow for a moment.

"Hello, little one. Do you know what happened here?" she asks the groundhog.

"It messed up our hole!" says the groundhog in an impossibly tiny voice.

"Who did?" says Galadriel.

"That...demon looking thing!" says the groundhog.

"Around what time was this?"

"The moon was up for a very long time!" says the groundhog. "I was confused!"

"Oh, that’s right. Sorry. What happened to the hole?" says Galadriel.

"The demon put these rocks all over it! And we had to re-dig it!"

"I’m so sorry. Can you describe the demon you saw?"

"It looked like it was very scared! Very frightened!"

"And was she holding anything?"

"Carrying a bag! About as big as me!"

"Did she say anything?"

"No! Just fled in terror!"

"Did she look injured?"

"No! Just very scared!"

"Did she have any weapons?"

"Maybe a small dagger!"

Galadriel translates and looks at Harlan and Hanamir, as if to say, A dagger, ehhhh?

"And did you see anything through the portal she made?"

"It felt cold!"

"Thank you so much, little guy. Do you want some food?" Galadriel crumbles up a bit of a granola bar and puts it on the ground. 

"Sure! But I’m watching my groundhog weight!" 

The groundhog picks up the granola and pops back in the hole with a voooop sound. 

"Gotta go!"

"It felt cold, he says," says Harlan, chewing his lip. "I bet the city of the dead is pretty cold."

"Or the mountains," says Hanamir.

"Guys? I have the strong sense that we’re being watched," says Galadriel. "I think Magic might be able to see us from the other side of the portal."

"Should we try and leave a message for her?" says Harlan.

"I think we can probably just talk to her," says Hanamir. He turns toward the stone circle. "Magic, we understand your motivations and we’re sympathetic. We, too, seek justice for the wrongfully murdered tieflings of your village. We’d love to work with you, if you’re interested. Please show yourself."

There seems to be no response, until Harlan points upward.

"Look!" he says.

There are words appearing in the clouds, disrupting the steady patter of the rain.

TOWN DEFENDED

...

WILLING TO MEET

...

ABERYTH?

"How about...in seven days?" Hanamir asks the sky.

SOUNDS GOOD

"Where in Aberyth, though?" says Harlan.

No more words appear in the clouds. 

---

"We have seven days to pursue other topics of interest, then," says Hanamir, leading the way back south. "And for my money, I want to know what happened to the stolen books from the orc encampment."

"We never looked at the temple near the encampment," says Harlan. "Would you want to head over there next?"

"Yes," says Hanamir decisively. 

It’s a long walk. The rain begins to clear as they pass by Eillin again, going around it instead of through it to avoid the heavy security at the border. By evening, they have reached the temple on the outskirts of the abandoned orc encampment. The City of the Dead is visible in the distance, surrounded by a stark obsidian wall. 

Hanamir does a quick stealth-lap around the temple to check for any obvious traps or guards. He finds no traps, and sees that there is only one door, slightly ajar, underneath a red glass window in the shape of a crescent moon. He sneaks inside. Galadriel and Harlan approach the temple but don’t enter, listening and waiting.

Two orcs are inside. They seem to be searching for something. Hanamir notices that they’re not dressed as Shargaas followers, and wonders if they might be looters. He approaches them.

"How ya doin’, brother?" he asks one of them.

"Brother? Who are you?" the orc asks, looking him up and down. The other orc chuckles in a series of grunts.

"Oh, just a traveler passing through," says Hanamir. Galadriel and Harlan grip their weapons.

"You happen to know what went down here, brother?" says the orc. 

"I know a lot of things," says Hanamir. He makes a quick signal behind his back. "Hell of a day, isn’t it?"

The orcs aren’t interested in chit-chat; they draw their swords. Harlan and Galadriel storm in to back up Hanamir. Galadriel throws up her iounstone and climbs up the wall, readying her crossbow and aiming it at one of the orcs.

Hanamir makes a swift slice at one of the orcs and kills him instantly.

"You wanna reconsider, friend?" he asks the other orc. 

The orc says nothing and takes a swing at Harlan. He misses, and Harlan crushes his skull with his hammer.

A third orc, dressed in some fancier armor, appears in the temple.

"Did you see what just happened to your two friends, brother?" asks Hanamir merrily, seemingly energized by the two one-hit kills. "Maybe you’ll think twice, if they didn’t."

The third orc conjures a spectral hammer and uses it to try and knock Galadriel off her perch on the wall. She loses her footing and takes some damage, but quickly rights herself. 

"Say, how’s your mother, son? Haven’t seen her in a couple months!" says Hanamir at the final orc. 

"OHHHH SNAP!" says Galadriel, absolutely living for this sassier-than-usual Hanamir.

The orc growls but says nothing. The mockery seems to have unsettled him, though, and Galadriel lands an arrow and Harlan a hit with his hammer. The orc swings and misses at Harlan.

"Something wrong with your arm, son?" says Hanamir.

The orc growls again and launches another unsuccessful attack. Harlan hits him again and he falls to the ground—not dead, but winded.

"If you let me go, I won’t knock the drow off the ceiling," he says to Hanamir, in Orcish. 

"Drow?" says Hanamir, then realizes Galadriel is rocking a drow-esque look today, what with the eyeliner. "Ah. You see, brother, part of the idea of a deal is that it’s a transaction. If you’re offering something, what’s the deal?"

"I won’t knock her off the ceiling..." wheezes the orc, spitting up a little blood.

"In exchange for?" says Hanamir.

"You not killing me," says the orc.

"Not killing you, like I killed your dad, you mean?" says Hanamir, prompting a DAAAAMN! from Galadriel on the ceiling. 

The orc glowers at him and makes a half-hearted swing.

"Haha, I’m just messing with you. How is your old man?" says Hanamir. He brings down his sword and kills the orc.

"That was pretty messed up," says Harlan, looking impressed but concerned.

"I want my books back," says Hanamir darkly.

They search the temple. Galadriel decides to climb over to the crescent-shaped window and punch out a pound of red glass, just in case that ever comes in handy again. Harlan checks out the dead orc’s fancy armor, and concludes that while it’s unusual, it’s not something he’s interested in taking for himself.

Behind a secret compartment in the altar, they find a book. It’s a title that was also part of Bryn’s collection: Anatomy of Bugbears, Second Edition. But inside this one is a sticker that makes Hanamir’s eyes brim with tears: 

*Propery of Drephis State University*

And, to make it worse: the book has been desecrated. Completely hollowed out. It’s nothing but a rectangular cavity between two covers and a spine.

"How dare they," he whispers. He has lost all of his earlier zest and humor.

Hanamir quakes with rage and puts the book lovingly in his backpack. It’s not much of a lead, but it’s the first he’s seen of his missing books in quite awhile—and he’s determined to find the rest.
