# Back in the game

After a long hiatus, we resume action mid-battle with [Bracket](/characters/bracket/). It’s Bracket’s turn.

- Bracket directs one of the guardian constructs to make two fist attacks against [Tannin](/characters/tannin/), which succeed; Tannin’s resistance to bludgeoning means he only takes 10 damage. Bracket then tries to get as far away from the crew as possible.

- [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/)’s up. He moves toward the nearest mechanical snake and deals 7 piercing damage to it. He also stuns it! It is stunned until the end of his next turn.

- The next-closest snake makes a lunge at Hanamir and tries to bite him, but misses.

- The third remaining snake attacks Cal, who makes a CON saving throw and passes. He’s not poisoned, but he takes 5 piercing damage.

- The second construct (not the one who attacked Tannin) moves to get [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) away from Bracket. It takes a swing at her with a large stone obelisk it’s using as a club. It hits her and knocks her prone, doing 8 bludgeoning damage. 

- [Chunk](/characters/chunk/) is up next, and he’s still in ape form. He goes up to the nearest snake and punches it. It takes 8 damage and is looking pretty bad.

- [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) attacks the same snake with Sacred Flame. It’s almost dead now.

- Galadriel gets to her feet. She lunges toward Bracket and tries to cast Bestow Curse again, but he passes his WIS save. She grants Hanamir Bardic Inspiration.

- Tannin uses reckless attack to stab Bracket with his trident. He does 9 damage. His second attack also hits and does 10 damage. This seems to hurt Bracket quite a bit (the guardian takes some of the damage, but not all of it).

- Cal has three attacks to use; he aims his first two at an uninjured snake and the third at the almost-dead snake. The uninjured snake is now severely injured, taking 35 damage, and the almost-dead snake is now 100% dead.

## A practical gnome

At this point, Bracket asks the two closest to him (Galadriel and Tannin), “What would it take to leave here with my life?” Tannin, in rage mode, does not have a response.

Galadriel responds: “Work for us, and you can have your life.” 

Bracket puts his hands up. 

“I’m willing to negotiate,” he says.

Bracket deactivates the constructs and the snakes and allows us to put the dimensional shackles on his wrists. He’s being cooperative—this is probably the most injured he’s ever been.

Galadriel: “If you’re willing to work for us to take down [Kaz](/characters/kaz/), [Odo](/characters/odo/), and potentially the AML, you could be a valuable asset to us. We’ll need as much information from you as you have.” 

Harlan: “Perhaps we should take something of his to ensure compliance.”

Meanwhile, Hanamir busies himself searching the workshop for evidence of Sky Arrow transactions. He finds some notes. As we know, the Arrow was in Bracket’s possession, and he was studying it. There’s a sketch of it: it looks like an actual arrow with some ornate markings on its surface. There’s also a list of tests he put it through: blasted it, poured stuff on it, etc. It was not reactive to water or flame.

Cal also searches the workshop for items relating to Lord [Deladriel](/characters/deladriel/). He finds some old transactions, which Bracket had told him about, so that checks out. The last-known Aberith address for Deladriel is also in there, confirming that Bracket was forthcoming with his information.

Bracket asks, “What are you asking me to do? If I work for you, what does that mean?”

Tannin wonders, “Should we have him give Kaz some sort of device that backfires?” He then brings up a counterpoint: “But if we kill him, will he really die? We’ve seen that fiends can’t be killed on this plane.

Galadriel: “We could use the quiznos and banish him, maybe.”

Harlan: “The first thing, I think, is to get him to tell us everything he knows about Kaz.”

Galadriel: “Good call. OK, step one, punk. Tell us everything you know. We know Kaz is a cat boy. What else?”

Bracket: “I don’t know what you mean by cat boy.”

Galadriel continues: “We’ve seen him out of his disguise! He’s a cat boy who walks on his hind legs. He’s a fiend from another plane.”

Bracket: “This is news to me.”

Galadriel makes an insight check to see if he’s lying. It seems true; he’s genuinely confused.

Bracket: “I assume the best way to kill him is by putting a knife into him. If you’re asking about ways to get to him, though, I could help with that.”

Harlan: “Yes please.”

Bracket: “I could tell you when our next meeting is, or arrange one…” 

He seems to be worried that we won’t find him helpful enough and will decide to kill him instead.

Tannin: “Do you know anything about banishing him to another plane?”

Bracket perks up.

“I have some knowledge of planes. I don’t know where he’s from, but I have texts that could be useful,” he says.

Tannin: “We don’t care what plane he goes to, we just want him off this one.”

Cal, with show-stopping nonchalance, chimes in, “Yeah. We’re tired of these mechanical snakes on this plane.”

Bracket: “You said he was a cat person, yes? There are several types of creatures that might be. Is there anything else you know about him? To help me narrow it down?”

Hanamir describes what he saw in the Mirror of the Past, along with the anecdote of his ability to read and alter minds.

Bracket: “I can’t say for sure. But if he’s shape shifting and a cat person… he might be a Rakshasa. There are a few things that I know about that. Killing him on this plane is agonizing, but not a permanent solution. It would send him back to the Nine Hells, but he could return to this plane. The only way to kill him permanently would be to kill him in the Nine Hells. 

Galadriel (*chanting*): “Let’s to go hell! Let’s go to hell!”

Bracket: “It’ll be brutal to send him back, mind you. And you’ll have made a lifelong enemy in doing so.”

Tannin: “Haven’t we already made a lifelong enemy?”

Hanamir shows Bracket the jade box holding the secret evidence that Kaz asked us to plant at Odo’s lair. 

Hanamir: “Can you open this without Kaz knowing?”

Bracket: “Hm. It’s definitely enchanted, and definitely would take time. I’m not sure how to do it so that it can be resealed.”

Hanamir: “Do you know how much time we’d have, if we killed Kaz, before he came back from the Nine Hells for revenge?”

Bracket: “He’d have to find the materials to perform the ritual that lets him escape the plane he’s bound to. That is not easily done, or else we’d be overrun. It’d take him months, at least.”

Hanamir: “Could we achieve the same result by banishing him?”

Bracket: “He wouldn’t need to spend as long recovering if he were just banished. He would have to find a way back. You probably wouldn’t have as long. The agonizing nature of being killed on this plane is part of the advantage there.”

The group discusses this. Bracket continues.

Bracket: “Kaz is expecting a delivery of goods I’ve manufactured for him in five days. If you want to do this without raising too much alarm, that would be the time and place.”

Cal: “Hey, as a show of good faith, do you want this demon armor back?”

Bracket: “Ah, yes. I was in a real bind with the Amber Guard trying to tell them where that went.” 

He seems genuinely grateful for that, and offers another tip.

Bracket: “If he is indeed a Rakshasa… his ability to shift form is one of his primary traits. So be wary of those you don’t know. There’s a good chance he’s keeping tabs on us in more ways than we’ve realized, if he is indeed one.”

## (5) Days of Downtime

So we have 5 days! 5 days of downtime to do whatever we want.

- Cal turns his attention toward the address for Lord Deladriel. He does some research. It’s an address in town, maybe Deladriel’s pied-a-terre in Aberith.
- So he goes, and there are some strange comings and goings from this address. He stumbles upon what looks like a small cult meeting in progress there. It’s not the AML, or the Messenger’s followers—it’s something else. 
- There are a lot of Dragonborn involved, about ten individuals, who seem to meet regularly. He overhears quite a bit. They don’t mention Deladriel, but they do mention the “Dark Leader” (and we can assume that’s Deladriel). 
- This cult is obsessed with the god Pholtus, a lower-tier lawful good god of light and life. They have this idea that Pholtus is an “impostor god.” They claim he has been replaced by an impostor.

---

- Galadriel tries to pursue [Buddy](/characters/buddy/). She sits alone, meditating, trying to connect spiritually with Lolth. She becomes aware of the fact that her senses have been cloudier than usual lately. It feels like focusing on static that’s been present in her ears for awhile. The more she focuses on it, she realizes there are two feeds: the world around her, and this static. 

- There are words in the static, and something is trying to communicate through it. There’s a request: “Bring something. Your friend is waiting.” But she doesn’t get a sense of where she should bring, and what. It’s a dark place, but not a place she’s been before. It seems like a place of Lolth, dark damp and wet. Now she has a choice: could tune it out. But might be difficult to hear again. Could allow it in, and it’ll affect her ability to hear the rest of the world. She decides to let it in.

---

- Hanamir goes to his secret boxing club and takes the sending stone from the basement where it’s been sitting with no activity. He puts in the Bag of Holding, with the intent of asking Tannin to dive deep somewhere later and dispose of it. He asks Left-Eye for a general update on news, politics, and the goings-on in Aberith.

- On the council: Haelon [Nyanceth](/characters/nyanceth/) has died; the position of Minister of Trade is now Trade and Sea. So council is [Kandir](/characters/kandir/), [Mirama](/characters/mirama/), and Vedit. Jao Vedit has begun to advocate for confronting the threats against the city. He thinks Aberith should have backed the Savage in providing an army to confront the orc threat. The interior threats, too, need to be taken more seriously. He tries to persuade Mirama and Kandir to send a force to confront these threats proactively.

---

- Cal recruits Chunk to help him infiltrate the cult meeting. They watch people coming and going from this place—it’s unclear when it’s actually empty. Early afternoon seems to be the best time to get in undetected, though meetings are at night. 

- It’s a small house with maybe only 2 or 3 rooms. Cal casts Pass Without Trace and they sneak in. They see a table with documents written in Draconic. There’s a bedroom to the back.

- In the bedroom there’s a sleeping Dragonborn who doesn’t wake up when they enter. He’s on a cot. There are some storage chests around the room and some assorted trash around, but nothing that reveals who these people are.

- Cal decides to set a small fire in the living room, take the documents, and then pretend to walk by outside and alert the Dragonborn that there’s a fire. This goes pretty well. Cal runs in yelling “fire!” 

- The Dragonborn wakes up and accepts Cal’s help. The building starts to fall down. Cal now has a minute to check out the chests (if he doesn’t die). Seems like normal stuff—a shortsword, set of knives, clothing, etc. But there’s also one more thing written in Draconic: a sealed-up scroll. 

- The fire is blazing really badly now. He takes one last rummage through some of the clothing and finds a note written in Common. It seems to be an order. “It will be important for you to complete your assignment ahead of schedule in light of the failure to destroy the Temple of Pelor.” He reads this as he rolls away when the ceiling collapses around him. He escapes. He catches himself on fire a bit to add to the realism of him trying to help.

---

- Tannin starts repairing the Half-Full Flagon. He has grown fond of it, so much that it feels like a home to him. He helps restock the bar with his brewing supplies and repairing the damaged structure.

- He checks in with Kir Mirama at night. Kir wants his opinion on whether Aberith should proactively pursue some of the threats as Vedit has suggested. Tannin’s not much of a political player, but he does care.

- He says, “I’ve told you about the clowns, Gehenna, the bug people… be prepared. You might have to go against your nature when it comes to doing things by the book.”
