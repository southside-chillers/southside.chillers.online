The giant spider blinks its uncountable eyes. Two swarms of tiny spiders flank it on either side, waiting for a signal to attack. [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) takes a step back. Will the gauntlet of Lolth prevent her from fighting? Or worse: will it cause her to turn against her friends? She feels an unnatural bond with the smaller spiders, but no such tenderness for the monstrous blue creature. This, at least, is a hopeful sign.

[Tannin](/characters/tannin/) and [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) charge forward at the spider and batter its shimmering hide with axe and maul. Harlan dodges a retaliatory attack from the spider, and, as if embarrassed, it disappears into thin air. Alas! It appears the adventurers are in battle with a _phase spider_.

Meanwhile, [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) is using his fists to smash as many small spiders as he can. He leaves one swarm badly depleted. Galadriel is still hesitant about joining the fray lest she become an unwilling ally of the spiders. She decides to help indirectly by casting Faerie Fire on the second swarm of spiders and endowing Hanamir with Bardic Inspiration as he continues crushing critters right and left.

Tannin develops a brutally effective attack against the swarms: the “axe blender.” Spider limbs fly in all directions from his spinning blade. Harlan reduces a number of spiders to a paste with his hammer. But in a flash of blue, the phase spider reappears and bites Harlan. He is poisoned to within an inch of death, and falls to the ground, unconscious.

Galadriel readies her crossbow and shoots the phase spider. The arrow hits, and the spider disappears again. Hanamir and Tannin wipe out one swarm of spiders entirely and use the axe blender technique to great effect on the other swarm. As Hanamir kills the last of the small spiders, the phase spider reappears and attempts to poison Tannin, who strikes a damaging blow with his axe. But Galadriel is ready. She shoots one more arrow at the massive spider and it collapses, dead, and then flickers out of existence.

Harlan stirs and opens his eyes. He’s still woozy, but he’s able to heal himself enough to stand up and inspect the gate-like altar that sits in the clearing. Sure enough, it’s a monument to his beloved storm deity. “Praise Kord!” he cries. 

The Voice of Kord praises Harlan’s valor in battle and offers him divine wisdom. Harlan asks for something to help the party find its way. Kord reveals that the dragon nest is only accessible from the river of fire. In the opposite direction, the tower is marked with a red hourglass, and there is no way to reach it on foot—they must go “above or below” if they wish to venture there. 

After a short, restorative rest, Hanamir decides to take the red glass goggles and climb the spider silk to the top of the tree. He sees that one source of the moon’s distress is very close, and the other is far to the east. (When he mentions this to the group, Harlan remembers from his clerical studies that there is some connection between Lolth and Shargaas, the orc god—could the eastern source be the Shargaas temple?) Hanamir also looks at the dragon crater, but there’s no sign of the dragon itself.

The party decides to climb the spider silk and attempt an approach to the tower from above, per Kord’s recommendation. Tannin attaches the spider silk to his javelin and launches it at the tree next to the tower. Miraculously, this works. Galadriel secures [Buddy](/characters/buddy/) the pig to herself with rope in a makeshift baby bjorn, and then they each zipline down the spider silk to the other tree, landing in the clearing next to the tower.

The tower is a stone octagon with a red hourglass embedded in its windowless walls. Galadriel senses that this tower intersects with other planes, and that Lolth followers from other planes come here to worship. It is, indeed, one of the sources of the moon’s occlusion. She knocks on the door, but there is no response.

Hanamir perceives that the door is unlocked and that there are no traps waiting for them immediately inside, so the group enters. They find a large empty room covered in blood stains—sacrifices to Lolth. Galadriel notes eight small divots around the central Lolth symbol and intuits that they have a ritualistic purpose. She feels the power of Lolth flooding through her, as if the gauntlet knows it is home.

As the group ascends to the second story, Tannin sets a bear trap behind them in case they are followed. Hanamir leads them down a hallway lined with arrow traps, all previously triggered. They step through more puddles of blood, but no bodies. 

The hallway leads them to a room with four large, wounded spiders. A pool of water has collected on the floor from a leak in the ceiling. Galadriel senses that the spiders were attacked in the last hour. Hanamir sneaks into the room and silently kills one. Galadriel is wracked with pain and feels her power diminish noticeably.

Harlan and Tannin both enter the room, not bothering to be stealthy. In fact, Tannin tries to intimidate the spiders with a roar, but his voice cracks instead. The spiders are not intimidated. They bite Harlan and Tannin. Hanamir sneaks up to disable one of the spiders, and Harlan knocks out another. They are careful not to kill them so as to avoid harming Galadriel.

Frustrated with her own uselessness, Galadriel tries to shoot the last spider, but some unseen force makes her hand slip, and the arrow hits Hanamir. Tannin is still shaken from his unsuccessful roar. He tries to punch a spider but hits himself in the face instead. Hanamir keeps his cool in spite of the friendly fire lodged in his shoulder and knocks out the last spider.

In the aftermath of this bungled battle, Harlan discovers a hole in the floor hidden by one of the spiders. It contains a green orb of unknown religious significance. He picks it up. In a brief vision, he sees a troglodyte—a fearsome reptilian creature.
