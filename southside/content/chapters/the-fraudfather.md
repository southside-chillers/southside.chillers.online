## Highlights

- Speak With Dead didn’t work on the fox man’s corpse. We got a “busy signal” from it.

- [Kaz](/characters/kaz/) was displeased that we intervened to stop the attack on the temple, because it meant blowing our cover. He wanted the stolen wand as a makegood, but ended up settling for four of the explosives [(Tannin](/characters/tannin/) got to keep one, being nostalgic for his necklace of fireball beads).

- Kaz doesn’t think another Sky Arrow-esque attack on the city is likely. He’s willing to offer us more information if we decide to work for him—and seems not so convinced that the Gehennans pose a real threat to him. He’s only swayed by [Harlan](/characters/harlan/)’s argument that they’re a threat to his business via the lives of his clientele.

- We give him the scrolls from the fox man’s corpse (no big deal, since [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) made copies). In return, Kaz gives Cal the promised letter of introduction to [Bracket](/characters/bracket/) the gnome, with directions on how to find him, and a reference book all about the creatures native to Gehenna. He also pitches an idea for how to clear [Goldpeak](/characters/goldpeak/)’s name: let someone else take the fall for the Sky Arrow attack, namely [Odo](/characters/odo/). We’d have to plant some evidence at Odo’s compound that would tie him to the crime… which Kaz can provide.

- There’s some real tension on this point. [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) accuses Kaz outright of selling the Sky Arrow to the AML. After failing a WIS save, she’s charmed into recanting that accusation. The party agrees to frame Odo for the Sky Arrow attack.

- The party goes to Bracket’s shop in the south of Aberith and uses a passphrase (“I’d like to find something to help with this weather”) to gain access to Bracket. Cal tells Bracket he’s here representing Lord [Deladriel](/characters/deladriel/), who needs a replacement for one of his metal constructs, which Bracket had built for him in the past. Cal, whose true mission is actually to find Lord Deladriel, fishes for information on past drop-off locations, but Bracket is not forthcoming. Bracket gives Cal a strange metal cube, claiming that it is the replacement Deladriel needs.

- The party continues to stake out Bracket’s shop after this encounter. After a little while, Kaz shows up! He’s carrying a bag. Galadriel casts Clairvoyance to listen in on the conversation between Kaz and Bracket:

**Kaz:** What did they want with you? How did they know who you were, and why did they come to me trying to find you?

**Bracket:** I don't know. The elf was asking about a former client of mine, Lord Deladriel.

**Kaz:** Alright, if that's all it was. Not of my concern. How did it resolve?

**Bracket:** Since they lied about who introduced them, I gave them a little treat. *(laughs to himself)*

**Kaz:** Those people might serve an important purpose for me.

**Bracket:** Oh, they'll be mostly alright.

**Kaz:** Haha, alright, alright. *(He opens up the bag. He brought the explosives.)* How did these get into the hands of the Gehennans?

**Bracket:** *(taken aback)* I've only sold these to two people: my official contract, and of course, to you. So you think that one of those two groups has been selling these further? On the black market?

**Kaz:** Is there reason to think anyone else could have gotten them? I suggest you are a little more careful. Make sure those you sell to aren't reselling.

**Bracket:** Well, there's no reason to think it's not someone in your organization who has been reselling these things. After all, there was a point in time when you had possession of the Sky Arrow.

**Kaz:** *(very upset)* You need to check with your other client and make sure there are no leaks on that side of the equation. I know I run a tight ship.

**Bracket:** *(knows he overstepped)* Understood.
