The adventurers run toward the rising chorus of shrieks and bellows. At the center of the chaos is a tiefling, who seems to be growing—a pair of horns now seven feet, eight feet, nine feet in the air, and a pair of shoulders ripping through a too-small cloak.

Some guards from the nearby bridge checkpoint descend on the scene, spears pointed at the giant figure. They struggle to manage the crowd of frightened onlookers. Rocks, fruit, and other small projectiles hurtle toward the tiefling from all sides.

The adventurers get close enough to catch a glimpse of the tiefling’s face, which is contorted in panic. 

“It’s Magic,” says [Harlan](/characters/harlan/). “That’s definitely her.” 

“She looks afraid,” says [Hermione](/characters/hermione/).

“I don’t think she planned this,” says [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/). “She was trying to stay incognito.”

They reach the back of the crowd. Harlan casts Thaumaturgy.

“YOU!” he says, pointing at Magic. The mob ahead of him parts, physically jumping out of the way of his voice. “WE HAVE BUSINESS WITH YOU.”

Magic turns toward Harlan and sees the group of adventurers. A flash of recognition and relief lights up her face. Harlan and [Tannin](/characters/tannin/) march up through the divide in the crowd and make a big show of grabbing hold of her arms. The guards do not make any moves to intervene.

“THIS TIEFLING IS WANTED FOR QUESTIONING, POTENTIALLY IN CONNECTION WITH A MURDER,” announces Harlan, mostly for the benefit of the guards, who squint at him from a few yards away. Turning off the Thaumaturgy, he whispers, “We’d been hoping to cross paths with you, Magic. We’re going to take you someplace where we can speak privately.”

“Oh, good,” says Magic. “I wasn’t sure how to find you all. I was trying to cast Skywrite, and then…” She gestures at her still-expanding frame. Half of a lemon, mostly juiced, hits her in the eye. “Ow!”

[Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) glances at the guards. They seem willing to cede the problem to Harlan, but the crowd is still screaming obscenities and hurling objects at Magic. She furtively casts Warding Wind, and a sudden gale begins whipping around her, with Magic and the adventurers in the relatively calm center. The wind is loud enough to drown out the sound of the mob, and it pushes them back far enough to clear a space to move. She waves the adventurers to follow her, and they proceed down the street in the direction of an empty-looking shipyard.

Hermione looks behind them and sees that the group of guards is following along, but at a distance. She points to a shabby old warehouse near the docks. They approach it, and it looks as though the guards are willing to wait outside and let them have a private conversation.

Galadriel’s windstorm begins to die down. As if soothed by the slowing breeze, Magic starts to shrink down to her regular height. They enter the warehouse through a heavy, creaking door. Its inside is all rusted metal, an empty cavern of stale and dusty air. 

“So, bad news, Magic!” says Tannin, clapping his hands together, stirring up a cloud of floating grime. “That potion you gave us? It does *not* take you back to your hut in the forest.”

“Oh, interesting,” says Magic. “It only ever took me there. I was so curious how it’d react with individuals of other species. Where’d it take you?”

“The Elemental Plane of Water,” says Tannin. He spins his trident like a deadly baton.

“Neat,” says Magic. She begins a sort of scattered, dreamy monologue. “Well, I did have limited resources while I was making those… and I did my best… and as you can see, I managed to get back on my feet after you all freed me from the forest… and now things are going great! I’m glad you all came... I was hoping to talk to you about something very important.”

She looks with uncertainty at Hermione, who is sneezing multiple times in succession.

“Sorry,” Hermione says between outbursts. “Hi Magic. I’ve heard a lot about you. I’m Hermione, and I too am a pur-pursuer of—” *Sneeze.* “—magical knowledge.”

“Hi,” says Magic.

“Listen, Magic, as glad as we are to see you, we weren’t kidding around about the whole murder thing,” says Harlan. “We need you to convince us you had nothing to do with the murder of our friend, Bryn Starloft.”

“Oh, I don’t know anything about that,” says Magic, instantly and obviously uncomfortable. “I wanted to talk to you about something else. You all were kind when I met you, and I was hoping I could recruit you to help me on my quest.” Her eyes widen, taking on a slightly manic quality. “I have a mission now that’s so much more important than anything else. When you all freed me from my misery in those woods, I found my purpose. And because it was you, there must be some connection between us. It’s—it’s *fated* that you help me on my quest. We were brought together for a reason.”

“Wait, Magic, hold on just a second,” says Galadriel. “Before we get into your quest, can I just ask… did you steal a book?”

“A book? Yes. I—I did take a book. I needed it for my quest. It’s the most definitive resource on dragonkind available in the world, so.”

“So you were at Bryn’s observatory, and you stole a book for your quest…” says Galadriel, trying to prompt Magic to finish the sentence.

“But I didn’t kill him,” says Magic with a strange laugh.

“Did he see you stealing the book?” prods Hanamir.

Magic doesn’t answer. She looks around the room, giggling.

“We like you, Magic. And we were so glad to let you out of the forest you were trapped in. But you need to be honest with—” starts Harlan, but he is interrupted.

“Why was I the only one spared? There had to be a reason. And now I know it!” she says.

“And what is that reason?” asks Hermione.

“To save the world! From everything—everything evil,” says Magic. She grins, and the adventurers allow a long moment of silence to pass.

“You know,” says Galadriel, “I’m no fan of evil myself. So I get why you took the book. But when Bryn saw you taking the book, did you feel… panicked at all?”

“He didn’t want me to have the book,” murmurs Magic. She sounds almost like a child.

“Did he try and stop you?” says Galadriel.

“He asked me not to take it.” Magic’s voice has dwindled to a near-whisper.

“And what did you do then?” says Galadriel.

“I took it.”

“And then?”

“I don’t remember.” Magic is staring intently down at her own feet.

“Huh,” concludes Galadriel. She purses her lips and gives the rest of the group a grim look. Harlan takes the opportunity provided by Magic’s distraction to cast Detect Magic on her, hoping to find an arcane explanation for her unusual behavior. 

“Whoa,” says Harlan. “I can feel… an *overwhelming* amount of magic flowing through her. But there’s no particular spell being cast… no particular school of magic… it’s just magic itself, the source of all magic that weaves through all of creation…” 

Magic does not react to this statement. She continues looking at the ground, her lips mouthing inaudible words.

“Hey, out of curiosity,” says Hermione gently, “what types of magic have you been doing lately, if you don’t mind my asking?”

“Oh, I’m trying to keep a low profile here, so not… not much…” says Magic.

“You just enlarged yourself in the street,” Hermione reminds her.

“That was an accident. Sometimes I make mistakes.” Magic shrugs.

“Wow, you don’t say!” snorts Tannin.

At this point, Hanamir slips away from the group. He doesn’t have much to say to Magic that the others won’t cover. He figures it’d be wise to get a read on their situation, especially as far as the guards outside are concerned.

Hanamir tiptoes to the door and places an ear to it. He can hear the guards chatting with one another, but they are far enough away that he can’t understand their conversation. *Good*, he thinks. He uses a piece of scrap metal to bar the door. He then walks the interior perimeter of the warehouse and discovers another door on the opposite side of the building. *Good*, he thinks again. 

He returns to the center of the warehouse, where it seems Harlan, Galadriel, and Hermione are still cajoling Magic to talk about Bryn’s murder. Tannin has become distracted by an oily puddle of water next to them and is staging battles between iridescent water-dwarves and water-giants.

“We really do want to hear more about your quest, but we can’t until we figure out what happened to Bryn,” says Harlan. “He was our friend.”

“And I’ll be real with you, Magic. It sounds like you killed him,” says Galadriel.

“No! I would never hurt anyone! I’ve simply been learning… just trying to gather information! I needed that book,” says Magic. Then she falls limply into an eerie, full-body shudder. 

As she does, a burst of magical energy erupts from her hands. While Harlan and Galadriel look on in consternation, Tannin transforms into a hideous ooze, Hanamir a winged demon, and Hermione a large, fiery wolf. 

Magic yelps and starts running for the door. Hanamir, in demon form, chases her down and grabs her by the hem of her cloak, bringing her down to an undignified face-plant on the floor. 

“I’m sorry! I’m sorry for running!” she cries.

Harlan catches up and attaches the dimensional shackles to Magic’s legs. He then turns to the demon next to him.

“Just checking, you’re all still in there, right? And aren’t really terrible monsters?” he asks.

“Yep, still me,” says Hanamir from the demon’s mouth.

“Me too,” says the wolf with Hermione’s voice.

A small, walking mechanical cube appears in the room. It swivels around slowly, as if getting its bearings. It is quite cute.

“Tannin, is that you?” says Harlan.

“Nah, over here,” comes Tannin’s voice from the horrible ooze.

“Magic, did you cause these illusions?” asks Galadriel. “What’s going on? And who’s the little guy?”

“Look, sometimes accidents happen! I told you!” says Magic, struggling with her shackled legs. “I was trying to get away, and—and—sometimes things just happen.”

“Now would be the time to tell us why you’re infused with so much magic,” says Harlan. 

“I’ve been studying!” Magic flails. “I’ve been reading!”

The cube creature approaches Hermione’s wolf form.

“Hello,” she says. She repeats this in multiple languages, just in case.

“Well, gr-r-r-reetings!” says the cube. It speaks Common, with a bit of a robotic clicking in its voice. It swivels again, observing them all.

“Whatcha doing here, little friend?!” asks Galadriel, with the fanatical look on her face that Harlan interprets to mean they will soon be adopting yet another wayward creature.

“I d-d-d-don’t know,” says the cube. “I think your friend accidentally b-b-b-b-brought me here.” 

The cube tilts its body toward Magic.

“Don’t worry,” says Galadriel. “We’ll do what we can to get you back home. Where are you from?”

“I am from the Plane of Mechanus,” says the cube.

“What’s your name?” asks Hermione.

“I do not have a name. I am just one of the d-d-d-d-duodrones.”

“What’s that?” Hermione tries to reach for her notebook, but realizes she is still a wolf and cannot write.

“I was once a monodrone. Now I am a duodrone,” says the cube.

“Oh, congratulations,” says Hanamir.

“Well, a duodrone had to d-d-d-d-die. There can only ever be the same number of us. Such is the order of things.”

“Oh, my condolences,” says Hanamir.

“Yes, yes,” says the cube.

“How can we help you get back home?” asks Harlan.

“I will try to cont-t-t-tact Primus,” says the cube. It starts making a whirring noise and walking in a perfect square. 

“Hey, until you find a way back home, do you want to hang out with us?” says Galadriel.

“Not you,” says the cube. It continues whirring, but sounds displeased. Galadriel’s mouth falls open in shock.

“What about me, big guy?” says Hanamir.

“You’re okay,” says the cube. It walks in another perfect square and sits down, an antenna emerging with a click from its top surface.

“Fine,” says Galadriel, blinking back angry tears. Harlan stifles a laugh.

“You’re crying because this cube we just met doesn’t like you?” he says.

“I’m not crying!” She crosses her arms and turns back to Magic. “So, tell us about your quest, then.”

“So you’ll help me?!” says Magic. 

“Just tell us about it,” says Galadriel.

“We have to get a weapon. There’s this weapon—and I learned about it—it’ll end evil. It can slay anything with a thought. And it can only be used once, and I know how to use it,” rambles Magic.

“What’s it called?” asks Harlan.

“Que—quet—quiz—I don’t know how to say it,” says Magic. “But I was hoping you all would help me find it. I know it exists. And with it, I could expel an entire evil population from the planet.”

“What evil population did you have in mind?” asks Hermione.

“The ones that terrorize us! I will have my vengeance!” Magic says with a surge of righteous anger. “At first, I wanted just to slay Grizzleby… he killed everyone I ever knew…”

“Grizzleby, the, uh, *red* dragon?” interjects Harlan, with a glance at Galadriel.

“Yes! Of course!” says Magic, exasperated. “Keep up! But then I thought, Grizzleby isn’t the cause. He’s merely a symptom—of the evil of all dragons. I must eliminate dragonkind!” She looks at them all in turn, heaving big triumphant breaths at having finally reached her thesis statement. “And all we need to do is go and get this weapon and bring it back here.”

Magic digs in her pockets and holds up some hand-scrawled notes and pages torn from books. One of them contains a map. She points at one area in particular, an ancient ruin.

“This is the last place the artifact was seen,” she says. “And if I find it, I can rid the world of this evil—and all will be well…”

“That sounds like a noble cause,” says Galadriel delicately. “Where did you find all these papers?”

“I have been searching… traveling around. I found some of the most important books. I can feel them, the books that have the information I need! It’s fate… I found the book from your friend that way, and several others…” she trails off, realizing she’s led the conversation back to the death of Bryn.

“Were any of the owners of the other books unhappy about you taking their things?” Hermione says.

“Most weren’t home,” Magic sidesteps.

“Most,” says Tannin, whose ooze appears to be spreading to nearby surfaces.

“Listen,” says Harlan, starting to sound exasperated, “we would like nothing more than to help you however we can, but if you lie about killing our friend—”

Suddenly, a clap of thunder knocks all of them back about ten feet. The cube creature disappears. Those who had been transformed into monsters are returned to their original bodies, just in time to bruise themselves on the warehouse floor. 

“Stop!” cries Galadriel. “You can’t keep doing this and expecting us to help you!”

“I didn’t mean to! I promise!” says Magic. “I’m sorry!”

“What were you trying to do that time?” asks Hermione.

“Nothing!” says Magic.

Galadriel dusts herself off and walks back to where Magic sits, shackled and trembling. She casts Suggestion.

“Magic, we are your friends. But we can’t help you if you won’t be honest with us. You need to tell us the full truth of what happened with Bryn,” she says, in the most feather-soft voice she can summon.

Magic holds her hands over her lips, eyes wide. She looks to be deep in an internal struggle. She tries stuffing her own fist in her mouth, without success, before screaming,

“I KILLED HIM! I DID IT! I DIDN’T MEAN TO, BUT I KILLED HIM! ... I DON’T KNOW WHY I’M SHOUTING!”

If the guards weren’t already curious about the sound of the blast, this enthusiastic confession is enough to summon them to the warehouse door. They shove against it and realize it has been barred; then they pound forcefully on its heavy metal exterior.

“Open up!” shouts one of the men. “By order of the Amber Guard!”

The adventurers look at each other, hoping one of them will have a clear idea on how to proceed. 

“Do we entrust her to the justice system of Aberith now?” whispers Harlan.

“Maybe we try to take her to Frunk instead?” says Hanamir.

“She’s mentally unstable,” says Galadriel. “They’ll probably spend five minutes with her and then execute her.” She glances around the warehouse. Nothing but old, unidentifiable debris to work with. “Damn. I’ll just—we need to buy some more time.” She tries out a new spell, this one known in her songbook as Leomund’s Tiny Hut. 

In an instant, a structure of four walls and a distinctive hat-shaped rooftop surrounds the party. The walls are translucent from the inside but opaque from the outside. The entire edifice swirls with all the colors of the rainbow, shifting and shimmering like light on a beetle’s wing. 

“It’s even cooler than I thought it would be,” murmurs Galadriel. She sniffs the air. “[And does it smell like tomatoes to anyone else? And… cheese?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HpCJov3Uj0)”

The adventurers look at each other, nodding.

“I’m going to go hide and back you up if things go south,” says Hanamir, darting out of the hut and disappearing somewhere in the shadows of the warehouse.

“All right, then,” says Harlan, clearing his throat and nodding to Galadriel. “You want to go initiate negotiations with the guards, or should I?”

“I’ll go,” says Galadriel. 

“And I’ll jump in with the muscle once you’ve got them distracted!” says Tannin.

“I’m hoping that won’t be necessary, but I appreciate it,” says Galadriel. “Let’s play it by ear.”

She squares her shoulders and walks out of the hut to approach the barred warehouse door. 

“Officers,” she begins, “we know you heard some alarming things just now. We have secured a confession from the tiefling to the murder of Bryn Starloft, a renowned scholar and friend of King Slee.”

“We know who Starloft was,” says the voice of a guard. “We’re here to take the tiefling.”

“You should know that she’s suffering from severe magical instability right now,” says Galadriel. “If I open this door, I need your word that she’ll be placed in the care of a skilled magician rather than summarily executed. At least not until her condition is examined by an expert and she’s had a fair trial.”

“Uh,” says a different guard. “Okay. Open the door.”

Galadriel removes the bar from the door and opens it a crack.

“So I have your word, then, that—”

The guards in their amber robes shove the door all the way open and barge into the warehouse, nearly flattening Galadriel. They stare at the rainbow-colored, pizza-smelling hut.

“What in the Nine Hells?” says the tallest guard. “Is the tiefling in there? And the rest of your friends from the street?”

“Yes,” says Galadriel. “It’s a small magical force field—a tiny hut, if you will—and if those inside it choose to leave, they may do so. But you will be unable to enter.”

“End it,” says the shortest guard. “End the spell now, or you will be considered an accessory.”

Galadriel stares him down, arms crossed.

“I will not end it unless you promise she’ll get help,” she says.

“That’s enough out of you,” says the middlest guard. He casts Hold Person on Galadriel, and she freezes in her defiant pose. Her eyes blink rapidly. If the guard were paying attention, he’d see that she was calling him many unkind names in Morse code.

“Now’s my moment! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAGHHH!” Tannin barrels out of the tiny hut. He lands a spectacular headbutt right to the middlest guard’s gut, knocking him to the floor. 

The shortest guard casts Hold Person on Tannin, who is suspended in a triumphant post-headbutt stance.

“All right, anyone else in the hut, time to go,” says the tallest guard. 

Hermione and Harlan exit the tiny hut with their hands up. 

“Where is the tiefling?” asks the middlest guard. He has mostly recovered from the indignity of Tannin’s headbutt, but still looks a little pink behind the ears. 

“Still inside. We shackled her ankles, as a precaution, so she has a hard time walking,” explains Harlan.

“I said everyone out,” says the tallest guard. “Go back and bring the creature out now. Carry it if you must.”

“Look,” says Hermione, “we are on your side. We don’t want this to end in bloodshed. Can we just talk to the king before you do anything?”

“No,” says the shortest guard. “This is a matter for the Amber Guard to handle according to our protocols. There will be no special treatment for you or for this tiefling.”

“But we’ve been entrusted by the Mayor of Eillin, and by King Slee himself, to bring their friend’s killer to justice,” says Hermione. “We must be part of that process. You can’t take her without us.”

“We can and we will,” says the tallest guard. “You—the human—what’s your name?”

“Harlan Stormborne, sir, Cleric of K—”

“Great. Go back in the hut and bring out the tiefling.”

Harlan sighs. Without addressing anyone in particular, he announces, “I think we need to comply. We can’t fight this with two of us frozen.”

Galadriel blinks something furiously.

Harlan disappears into the hut for a minute or two, then re-emerges with Magic. He has removed the shackles from her ankles and attached one of them to his own newly-intact left wrist and the other to Magic’s right wrist.

“All right, here she is,” he says. “But these are dimensional shackles. You won’t be able to remove me from her. So whatever you do to her, you do to me too.”

“This is ridiculous,” mutters the shortest guard. “Why do you even care? She just confessed to killing someone!”

“But you don’t know all the information!” says Hermione. “You are missing some key details about this situation and you don’t seem to want to listen!”

“We’ll figure out all the details when we take her in,” says the middlest guard. 

“But—” starts Hermione.

“Are you trying to say you have relevant information to this murder case? That makes you a witness, honey.”

“I didn’t witness it! We just have *important contextual information* about this person that you *must* take into account before you—”

“Enough. Enough. You’re all coming in,” says the tallest guard. He conjures some thick, ropelike vines from the floor and binds Hermione’s hands.

“Explain yourselves! This is unacceptable!” Hermione squawks. “Let me speak to your boss *right now*!” 

“You’ll get your chance,” says the shortest guard. “Don’t worry.”

Tannin and Galadriel are unfrozen and immediately shackled together. Harlan and Magic follow them. Hermione refuses to stop kicking, and thus ends up with both arms and legs shackled, hoisted over the tallest guard’s shoulder. To the outside observer, their procession toward the Barracks looks like the punchline to some kind of complicated joke.

Meanwhile, Hanamir hangs back. When the guards are at least thirty feet away, he slips out of the warehouse and follows along.

“Hey,” Harlan whispers to Magic as they trudge side by side. “Don’t panic. We’ll get through this together.”

Magic glances down at him, looking very much like a frightened child.

“Please don’t leave me,” she says.

At the Barracks, the guards lead them to a row of jail cells. Hermione flails with a renewed vigor at the prospect of her reimprisonment.

“We’re on the same side!” she cries. “I don’t understand why you’re putting me in here!”

“Because right now you’re under arrest,” says the middlest guard.

“No I’m not!” says Hermione.

“I’m afraid that’s not up to you, ma’am,” says the tallest guard.

“One cell per person,” barks the shortest guard in the direction of Harlan and Magic. “You can stay together for a minute or two, but you’ll have to separate once we get the containment chamber set up for her.”

“You can’t put me in containment with her?” says Harlan. “Her mental state right now is very fragile. I think having a friend nearby might help keep her stable.”

“Look, man. You’ve been the easiest to deal with,” says the tallest guard, “though that’s not saying much. But believe me, you don’t want to be put where she’s going.”

“Can I at least keep watch over her?” he asks.

“Fine, I suppose. For now. Unshackle yourself.”

Harlan complies. The guards escort him and Magic to an interrogation room and call in someone who looks like the boss—a man wearing flowing amber robes with a few important-looking pins by his shoulder. He begins conjuring a colorful orb that expands to surround Magic, layering it with coats of radiant energy until she is seven layers deep in a magical containment bubble like a gobstopper. It would be beautiful, Harlan thinks, if it weren’t for the expression of terror on Magic’s face.

The Amber Guard boss does not speak to Harlan, but sits down across from him. After a few minutes, the lesser guards bring in another person of seemingly high rank. She is a short, stout woman in dark military garb.

“I am General Pouru,” she states, addressing Harlan. “I am Aberith’s Minister of War. I understand you have information regarding the disappearances that have been plaguing the city.”

“Oh, actually, no,” says Harlan. He is more nervous in front of these officials than he thought he would be. “Um, this is about a murder—a scholar named Bryn Starloft was killed in Eillin not long ago, and this tiefling here, by the name of Magic, has confessed that she is responsible. But I don’t have any information on the disappearances.”

“We believe the information you have will help resolve both issues,” says the general.

“I would caution against jumping to conclusions,” Harlan says. “I know of no reason to believe she’s involved in the disappearances. And, as far as the murder is concerned, my companions and I believe that she is not in control of her faculties right now. She might not understand what she has done. You, sir—” Harlan nods at the Amber Guard boss who conjured the containment bubble. “—I’m sure you can sense the overwhelming amount of magic that is coursing through her right now.”

“We appreciate your input, but a threat to the city is a threat to the city, and we will deal with it how we see fit,” says General Pouru. 

The Amber Guard boss remains silent, but looks at the general and nods his head in the direction of the hallway. 

“Excuse us for a moment,” says General Pouru. She and the Amber Guard boss leave the interrogation room and shut the door. Harlan can hear the faint, muffled back-and-forth of an argument, but can’t make out any words. It sounds heated.

After awhile, the general returns, but the Amber Guard boss does not. 

“So. Describe to me what you’ve seen this tiefling do, in terms of the uncontrolled magic you mentioned,” she says.

Harlan recounts the unintended growth spurt, the monstrous transfigurations, the summoning of a duodrone from the Plane of Mechanus, and the blast of thunder. 

“And that’s all just stuff that happened *today*,” he says. 

“I see,” says General Pouru. “And nothing about that behavior suggests to you that this creature could have, intentionally or not, caused the disappearances?”

“I suppose it’s possible,” says Harlan. “But I would just ask that you not rush to judgment, and take the appropriate steps to ensure that justice—”

“There’s a reason why we’re not doing this through the regular channels,” says the general.

“There is?”

“I am the Minister of War. We’re at war. My job is to win the war,” she says.

“Pardon my ignorance, but with whom is Aberith at war?” asks Harlan.

The general sidesteps the question.

“Whoever is causing citizens to disappear is an enemy of Aberith. We will keep you and your friends here until we decide what to do,” she says.

“How long?”

“As long as it takes,” says the general. “You will join your friends in the cellblock. The tiefling will be held separately.”

“Are you absolutely certain that I can’t accompany her?” pleads Harlan. He glances at Magic, who looks shrunken into herself. She has her arms wrapped around her legs and rocks back and forth at the bottom of the multilayered bubble. “She’s in a very vulnerable place, and I just—”

“No,” says the general. 

She opens the door for an amber-robed mage, who dispels the bubble. At that moment, both the general and the mage find that their feet are stuck to the floor, as if their legs are pillars of stone.

“Hey!” shouts the general. She struggles to move. “Amber Guard!”

A dozen more robed guards flock to the interrogation room. One of them pulls Harlan from his seat and escorts him back to the cellblock, where Tannin, Galadriel, and Hermione sit dejectedly in their cells. 

“How’d it go?” asks Tannin.

Angry voices leak from the direction of the interrogation room. More guards rush to help unstick the general. Harlan’s guard shoves him into a cell and locks the door. 

“Not great, Tannin,” says Harlan. “Not great.”
