We left our heroes on a terrifying cliffhanger. While Harlan and Tannin face a shower of arrows from above the temple, Galadriel has been taken hostage by four orc cultists and a vicious bugbear within. The temple attendants have been brutally murdered.

Tannin, in a barbarian rage, breaks down the temple door with his portable ram. Battle commences, but it’s a weird one: there’s a lot of swinging at each other and missing. The two cultists in front come at Harlan and Tannin with scimitars and whiff the air. Tannin hits one with his battle axe and Harlan finishes the job with his orcish maul. 

Out of nowhere, our most pond-resembling compatriot, Hanamir, emerges from his hiding place and frees Galadriel from the bugbear. He then strikes at the bugbear and misses; Galadriel, thrilled to be rescued, takes a swipe at the bugbear’s exposed thigh with her rapier and hits. The bugbear retaliates with a swing of his deadly morning star and deals considerable damage to both Hanamir and Galadriel. 

Meanwhile, Tannin and Harlan battle the second and third cultists at the front of the temple. There’s more swinging and missing, and the fourth cultist rushes to the front to join the fray. Tannin succeeds in killing the second one with his battle axe. The third cultist mysteriously sacrifices himself while the fourth starts chanting and shrouds himself in flames—alas! A mage! 

Hanamir and Galadriel knock the bugbear unconscious. The chanting mage, affectionately known as Chanto, conjures a floating hand above the bugbear’s body, and uses magic to disappear and reappear in the corner of the temple. When Hanamir confronts him, Chanto demands to know our heroes’ purpose. “To learn what threatens the moon!” Hanamir replies. Chanto retorts, “Shargaas threatens the moon!” and conjures three darts that hit Hanamir, Galadriel, and Harlan. 

Sensing that the floating hand is trying to revive the bugbear, Galadriel puts the creature out of its misery. Tannin intimidates the mage, who backs down and urges the party to leave—“We were in the middle of something!" Harlan heals Galadriel, who then heals Hanamir. Hanamir uses sleight-of-hand to attack the mage, but he disappears.

Our heroes are now alone in the temple. Tannin smashes the window containing the precious red glass, taking it. Hanamir has the clever idea to position the dead bugbear in the broken window to explain the damage.

Perceiving a staircase underneath one column, Hanamir leads the party downstairs. It's pitch black. Using their combined powers of perception, darkvision, and stealth, the group avoids several pressure traps in the darkened corridor. _Slam!_ The mage from upstairs jumps out from underneath a cot and strikes Hanamir with his staff. Hanamir perceives a sleeping bugbear in another cot close by, and elects to stab-then-punch the bugbear in rapid succession. 

Tannin swiftly cuts down the mage with his battle axe. Harlan lights his holy symbol to provide some light in the darkened basement. Galadriel shoots the bugbear in the head, killing it. The party is alone once more.

Hanamir notices another cot around the corner covered in blood—some poor temple attendant perished there, it seems. Tannin checks the mage's body and recovers 20 gold pieces, which the party splits evenly. The mage also has a map of the area west of town, including the burning woods, with a spot marked in the woods. Tannin keeps the map.

Galadriel perceives that there is another trap on the ground and advises the party to avoid it. The group inspects one last cot and the bookshelf next to it. The books are all about the goddess of the temple, Eilistraee, and contain information about her lineage. She is the daughter of a lawful good father (elf?) and of Lolth, the spider goddess. They read that the town, Eillin, once had many followers of Lolth, but they were driven out. Galadriel takes two of the most interesting-looking books with her.

Tannin shoves the bookshelf aside and finds a ladder behind it. Before climbing the ladder, the group decides to inspect the corpses they've left behind. The bugbear only has a mace, of no interest to anyone. The cultists upstairs have several symbols of Shargaas, their orc god, which the party decides to take. Galadriel finds an enchanted shawm and adds it to her collection of instruments. 

The party returns to the ladder downstairs and climbs it. It leads to a platform with a locked door, marked by the symbol of a harp. Galadriel first checks the door for magic, finding none. She then tries the key she collected from the body of an orc in the well to open the door. It fits! 

Inside, they find one book, also marked with the symbol of a harp. Galadriel decides to keep it, but doesn't tell the party why. There's also a chest, full of nice weapons and gold, which the individuals of the party take according to their interest. 

For now, our heroes decide to return to town to take a long rest. They all dream sweet dreams of leveling up.
