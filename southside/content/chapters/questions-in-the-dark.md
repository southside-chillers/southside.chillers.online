**INT. LOLTH TOWER -- NIGHT**

The body of a wyrmling dragon lies dead on the stone floor, The remains of a death slaad not far away. Our heroes stand outside the last closed door. It is 1 a.m. on the day before the moon festival.

**Orc**: When are you going to let me out of here?!

**[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/)**: What do you think? Should we rest, or talk to the orc?

**[Harlan](/characters/harlan/)**: We should talk to the orc first and then deal with the priest upstairs.

**[Tannin](/characters/tannin/)**: Let’s release the orc and tell him to go upstairs and kill the priest while we take a rest.

the group ignores this idea.

**[Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/)**: Orc first, then rest, then priest.

**Hanamir**: All right. Here goes. (in Orcish) How ya doin’, brother?

**Orc**: I said, let me out of here.

**Hanamir**: Well, compadre, I need to know first who you’re working for and what brings you here.

**Orc**: I think you can tell I’m not working for these fools. So just let me go and we’ll sort this out when I’m out of here.

**Hanamir**: Are you interested in revenge?

**Orc**: Whatever! Just let me out!

**Hanamir**: I’ll make a deal with you: there are some priests upstairs, the guys who locked you up…

**Orc**: I’m not going head to head with a priest of Lolth. How do you think I wound up in here?

**Harlan**: Ask if there is anything he can offer us in exchange for letting him out.

**Hanamir**: Yeah. Is there anything you can offer us in exchange for letting you out?

**Orc**: I’m your fellow orc! Let me out!

**Hanamir**: Ahem. My friends and I will discuss it. Thanks for your time.

The orc can be heard punching the wall.

**Hanamir**: (in Common) I see no reason to let him out.

**Tannin**: We should totally let him out.

**Galadriel**: I think we should at least try and do more talking first. Maybe get to know him, ask him his name… relate to him on a personal level! You’re brothers!

**Hanamir**: Half-brothers. And the orcs we’ve met so far have all been antagonists. This guy is coy about who he’s working for, and I don’t trust him.

**Harlan**: Maybe ask him how he got here, and see what his side of the story is. Do a good cop bad cop scenario.

**Hanamir**: (in Orcish) So what’s your story? I’m a loose cannon, myself.

**Orc**: I was doing some favors for these people, so I was working for them at one point… and look, things went south, and I just need to get back to where I came from. That’s all I ask.

**Hanamir**: Do you know about any books?

**Orc**: ………..what kind of books?

**Hanamir**: Any kind of books. Maybe books getting picked up off a caravan?

**Orc**: Okay… I didn’t realize they belonged to the university. I don’t have the books. I can tell you what happened to them if you let me out.

**Hanamir**: I’ll let you out. And you’re gonna walk free, and you’ll tell your boss that Hanamir wants his books back. Hanamir’s comin’.

**Orc**: It’s a deal.

**Hanamir**: (in Common) Will the rest of you find a good place to stand so you can ambush him in case he turns on me?

the group readies itself. Galadriel climbs up the wall to sit above the door.

**Harlan**: You know what I’ll do? I’ll cast Locate Object on the Shargaas amulet. You give it to him, and we can track him that way.

**Hanamir**: Good idea.

Hanamir arranges the scene so that he’s standing with one foot casually resting on the body of the slaad. He pulls the last lever to open the door, releasing the orc.

A somewhat bloodied orc emerges. He wears armor; he’s a warrior.

**Orc**: Here’s the situation. We had to sacrifice some of your books. As you may know, Shargaas demands tribute of stolen goods, and we figured it was an easy way to sacrifice something to him.

**Hanamir**: You figured wrong, brother.

**Orc**: Are we going to hold to the bargain?

**Hanamir**: Yes. Hanamir keeps his word. (he throws the orc the amulet.) Take this and remember to tell your boss... Hanamir’s coming.

**Orc**: Where did you get this?

**Hanamir**: It doesn’t matter.

**Orc**: Well, you held up your end of the deal, I’ll hold up mine and be on my way...Good luck with [Cazna](/characters/cazna/). _(he leaves)_

The group checks the orc’s cell. It smells pretty bad. Some rat bones...not too much else in there worthy of reporting. It seems he had been in there a week or two.

The group takes a short rest, restoring some energy and vitality. Hanamir is still not feeling his best, but the rest of the party is much better.

Looking down into the pit, Harlan notices something shiny. Hanamir dives in to retrieve it.

**Hanamir**: _(voice echoing in the water)_ Aha. I can easily identify this as a piece of azurite.

Hanamir climbs back up.

**Hanamir**: Check this out. Showed me a shark guy. _(he refers to a sahuagin, a shark-like creature)_

**Harlan**: I’m nervous about what we’re supposed to do with these orbs.

**Hanamir**: I think they’re related to planes… Gruumsh lives in another plane, shark people in the water plane…

**Galadriel**: Why does water get its own plane?

**Hanamir**: There are planes for lots of elements. This is common knowledge.

**Galadriel**: Sounds fake, but ok.

**Harlan**: Can we deal with this priest please??

**Tannin**: First let’s hide the dragon. Are we all in on this murder? Everyone’s fingerprints should be on it so that we’re bound to it. And no stealing any scales.

They look pointedly at Harlan.

The group pushes the dragon into the watery pit and then closes it. They are aware that this may have been the water supply of the residents of the tower and that the water will now be contaminated with dragon cholera, also known as flaming dysentery.

The group heads upstairs. Hanamir sneaks up first, as usual. They enter a long, straight hallway. There are several doors: the ones on immediate left and right are closed. There is an open door further down the hallway.

Hanamir goes to nearest door and tries to perceive any obvious traps. No traps; the area is well-trafficked; the floor is grooved from lots of people walking around.

Hanamir then opens the door on the right. It opens easily. He uses swat team hand signals that they went over during the short rest to encourage the group to follow him.

The room is a bedroom with cots and a bathroom in the back. Otherwise, the room is empty and unremarkable.

**Harlan**: _(whispering)_ Let’s close the door and search this room.

**Galadriel**: Or, close the door and take a long rest for the entire night. I need my spells back.

**Harlan**: That’s risky… we could get interrupted.

**Hanamir**: Yeah, we should keep going.

**Tannin**: We should try and silently murder everyone on this floor.

They search the room, only finding some drow clothing. Hanamir puts on a drow robe. It’s tight.

**Hanamir**: What’s a good thing to say to somebody in the dark that would make them think you’re an elf?

**Galadriel**: _I amar prestar aen. Han mathon ne nen._ “The world has changed. I can feel it in the water.”

**Hanamir**: Cool.

The group discusses the origin of drow, or dark elves, and concludes it’s a description of their alignment. They are mostly devoted to lolth, but some are not. They generally speak elvish and common. Some drow speak undercommon, and when they do, it is with a heavy australian accent.

Hanamir goes to the next closed door. He nudges it open. It’s a smaller room, single bed in it, with a drow sleeping in it.

She wakes up and notices Hanamir. Hanamir pulls the drow robe up over his face as much as he can.

**Hanamir**: _(in Elvish)_ The world has changed. I can feel it in the water.

**Drow**: _(in Elvish)_ What?

Hanamir attempts to knock her out. He hits her but she’s still conscious, though bloodied. He hits her again and succeeds in restraining her. The group closes the door.

**Tannin**: How many of you are on this floor?

**Drow**: Twelve of us in this tower.

**Tannin**: How many on this floor?

**Drow**: ...How many have you killed?

**Tannin**: No one yet. Are you a priest?

Galadriel, looking around, determines that this drow is a powerful figure.

**Galadriel**: _(in Elvish)_ We don’t have to hurt you. But we need to know what’s going on with the moon.

**Drow**: You’re far too late to interfere.

**Galadriel**: Why’s that?

**Drow**: We’ve already cast the binding magic.

**Galadriel**: What kind of magic?

**Drow**: Why should I cooperate with you?

**Tannin**: How many priests do we need to kill to stop this magic?

**Drow**: I thought you hadn’t killed anyone yet?

**Tannin**: ...How many more priests do we need to kill to stop this magic?

**Drow**: Look, what do you want?

**Galadriel**: We’re here to save the moon.

**Drow**: I told you, you’re too late for that. If that’s what you’re here for, just kill me.

**Galadriel**: At least describe to us what you did to the moon.

**Drow**: I didn’t do it.

**Galadriel**: Then who did?

**Drow**: Again, why should I cooperate? I’m not afraid to die at this point. I’ve fulfilled my mission.

**Galadriel**: (she casts charm person on the drow priestess, but it doesn’t work.) Okay, fine. I need you to help me out, sister. I’ve got a gauntlet that might belong to you.

**Drow**: (interested) Where’d you get that?

**Galadriel**: From my pig.

**Drow**: What?

**Galadriel**: (turns around to show buddy peeking out of her backpack, chewing on the drawstrings) This is Buddy. He had eaten the gauntlet, I don’t know where he got it. We made him throw up, and then I put it on.

**Drow**: So that pig ate a priest of Lolth???

**Galadriel**: No, I don’t think Buddy ate a person.

**Drow**: These are only worn by priests of Lolth.

**Galadriel**: Yeah, but he probably ate it off the ground somewhere.

**Drow**: I’m not sure that pig is what you think it is.

**Galadriel**: I’m pretty sure he’s an adorable pig and I’m pretty sure he’s my best friend.

**Drow**: Okay, well, I’ll take the gauntlet. If you don’t want it.

**Galadriel**: I do want it! I just don’t like being able to not fight spiders when necessary. Is there anything you can do about that?

**Drow**: Yeah, absolutely.

**Galadriel**: What can you do?

**Drow**: If you just take it off, I’ll fix it.

**Galadriel**: I can’t take it off.

**Drow**: Oh, I can take it off you no problem.

Galadriel notices that the drow is fidgeting with something and staring at the gauntlet, clearly coveting it. Tannin, Hanamir, and Harlan make moves to draw their weapons.

**Galadriel**: Hey, one more thing, is there anything you can tell me about these orbs? (she indicates the azurite, onyx, pink pearl, and jade.)

**Drow**: Again, I understand I’m being held hostage, but what exactly am I getting out of this if I tell you anything?

**Harlan**: What about your life?

**Drow**: What guarantee do I have that you won’t just kill me anyway?

**Harlan**: We let the orc go.

**Drow**: You let him go?! All right, then, you might as well kill me.

**Galadriel**: Who was he? Give us the deets!

**Drow**: He was a spy for Shargaas.

**Galadriel**: Aren’t you in league with Shargaas?

**Drow**: We were...until they double crossed us.

**Galadriel**: So now Shargaas is...protecting the moon?

**Drow**: No, they’re still going through with that, but they double crossed us. _(she pauses)_ You guys are in over your heads.

**Harlan**: She’s onto us.

**Drow**: Cazna and the followers of Shargaas both needed Eilistraee out of the way.

**Galadriel**: Who’s Cazna?

**Drow**: The high priestess of this temple.

**Galadriel**: That’s not you?

**Drow**: No.

**Harlan**: And where is she?

**Drow**: In her chambers.

**Galadriel**: Or she’s dead.

**Tannin**: You think? I think she’s at the top of the tower.

**Drow**: Yeah, she’s at the top. In her chambers. _(she pauses)_ If you all let out that spy… there are gonna be orcs here in a matter of hours.

**Tannin**: Aw.

**Harlan**: And you don’t want to be here when that happens. So tell us what we want to know, and we’ll let you live. We’ll let you go.

**Drow**: ...We had a plan. We thought the Shargaas followers wanted to destroy the city so that they could unseal the city of the dead. We wanted the city for ourselves again because we were run out of town. We discovered that they were infiltrating this tower so that as soon as Eilistraee was destroyed, they would kill us before we could take the town, because apparently that interferes with their plans.

**Harlan**: And these orbs?

**Drow**: They have religious meaning to us. They represent false gods.

**Harlan**: What do you do with them?

**Drow**: We stole them from followers of false gods as proof of our superiority over them. You can sell them on the black market. You can have them.

**Galadriel**: We have them already, lol.

**Drow**: Let me go now.

**Harlan**: Any other information? This is the time.

**Galadriel**: What do you think my pig is?

**Drow**: Something that could’ve eaten a high priest of Lolth.

**Galadriel**: Like what? What are the main predators of high priests of Lolth? Where on the food chain do they fall?

**Drow**: I really don’t know, but I’m concerned.

Hanamir tries to knock out the priestess, but she plane-shifts outta here. She had apparently been fidgeting with a plane-shifting fidget spinner.

The group quickly searches the room. There is a chest containing: 4 carved bone statuettes (a spider, a drow, a dragon, some trees), a copper chalice with silver filigree, and 2 embroidered silk handkerchiefs. Galadriel considers checking these items for magic, rolls a 1, and thinks to herself “it’s magical that there are bones inside all of us,” and forgets to do an actual check. Buddy sniffs the statues.

They each take a statue and divvy up the handkerchiefs and chalice (Galadriel takes none because gauntlet). Hanamir suggests Galadriel steal a priestess robe; she does.

They go back to the hallway and enter the next room with the open door. it’s set up like a jail cell, not decorated like the other rooms. this is a place for prisoners, but there’s no one inside.

Down the hallway, there’s an archway leading to another room, and there are two more closed doors on the left. they check out the archway. it leads to a dining hall with two long wooden tables. at the end there’s a stone altar with three lit torches above it. other than that, it’s empty. Hanamir encourages Galadriel to check the altar for magic. she determines that the pot roast that they serve there is pretty magical. Hanamir eats some and it’s delicious. is it made of human? we don’t know.

They move on to the next door, which is locked. Hanamir tries to pick the lock with his thieves’ tools. Harlan casts guidance of kord on him. Hanamir succeeds in picking the lock.

Inside the room, there are three people sleeping: two drow dressed in shabby clothes, and one non-drow elf. it’s hard to tell if they’re prisoners or there by choice. one drow is dressed in white, the other in a black robe. the non-drow elf is dressed in rags.

They notice a lute under the bed. Galadriel tries to see if it’s cool, or at least better than the one she already has, but can’t tell. Hanamir, with elaborate hand gestures, to team: kill them, or just keep them locked up?

**Galadriel**: Let’s dimensional-shackle two of the prisoners together, so they can’t plane shift and it’s harder for them to fight us.

**Harlan**: Let’s check out the one remaining room first.

So they leave and check the other door. Hanamir picks the lock on the door.

In this room, there are two drow sleeping. On the wall there is a shortsword, and in a pile at the foot of the bed, there’s some armor. Hanamir checks out the sword to see if it is cool. It is not.

**Hanamir**: (with silent hand signals) Murder time?

**Galadriel**: (with silent hand signals) I think these two are wardens, the other three are prisoners.

**Hanamir**: (with silent hand signals) Okay, when I give the signal, you sneak in and murder one of these guys with me.

Galadriel stealths in, leaving buddy in the hallway. Tannin is giving buddy the major side-eye.

Galadriel stabs one of the drow wardens in the neck with her shortsword and kills him. Hanamir tries but fails to kill the other one. He then tries to put the warden in a half-nelson, but the warden breaks free.

Galadriel tries to stab him, but misses. She casts bardic inspiration on Tannin. Tannin enters the room with a reckless attack and wallops the warden with his battle axe. Harlan charges in after and hits him with his hammer.

The drow warrior levitates out of the bed, 20 feet up.

**WARRIOR**: _(to Galadriel)_ Why are you doing this?

**Galadriel**: ‘Cause we’re trying to save the moon, man! (she remembers she is dressed as a priestess.) I mean, because I’m bad to the bone!

**Hanamir**: _(in Elvish)_ The world has changed. I can feel it in the water.

Hanamir throws a dart at the warrior. Galadriel climbs up the wall and stabs him with her shortsword, killing him. he falls back into his bed. a ring of keys falls out of his pocket.

Hanamir takes the keys.

They leave the room. Hanamir uses the keys to lock the door where the other three are sleeping. The group heads back to the dining hall and inspects a locked iron door inside. Hanamir uses the keys to open it. It leads to a store room containing yet more pot roast, and also treasure.

Hanamir opens a chest. It contains roughly 650 gold pieces’ worth of small gems.

Galadriel opens the next one. She finds a ioun stone of protection. When tossed in the air, it orbits one’s head and increases one’s armor class.

Harlan opens a chest to find 1400 copper pieces and 35 electrum. It’s super heavy and now he has to drag it around. Is it karma? who can say?

Tannin opens the last one. Inside is an exquisite collection of treasures: an enormous gold bracelet, a trident of fish command, and an ever-smoking bottle. Tannin wears the gold chain as a necklace and marvels at his new aquaman powers. He tosses the smoke bottle to Hanamir, since sneaking’s not really his style.

Back in the dining hall, a voice can be heard.

**VOICE**: Hello?
