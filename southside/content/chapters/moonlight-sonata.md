“Welcome back,” whispers [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/). [Buddy](/characters/buddy/) is now napping in her lap, and she strokes his head. “That was a dramatic finale to our quest, wasn’t it?” 

Buddy oinks a little in his sleep, and she looks down at him with pure adoration.

“I bet you’re wondering how dope this party is going to be,” says Galadriel. “Don’t worry. You’ll find out soon. We rejoin our heroes back at the top of the tower, looking at three mysterious curtains.”

You see in the flashback window that [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) is perusing the Big Book of Planes that Gruumsh gave him. 

---

“I think the turquoise curtain is the one we want, team,” he says, chewing on his lip thoughtfully. 

“Onward, then,” says [Harlan](/characters/harlan/). They pass through it one by one and the nature of reality does a few backflips. They land near the base of the hill outside of Eillin. They look up at the observatory and see that [Bryn](/characters/bryn/)’s lights are on. The sun is setting, and an enormous full moon glows over the town.

“Shall we check in with dear old Bryn?” says Hanamir.

“Yes. I can’t wait to tell him those glasses were completely useless,” says Galadriel.

“Not completely,” says Hanamir, who still has them propped atop his head. He brings them down to rest on his nose and the look is undeniably fierce.

When they reach the top of the hill, Bryn is already at the door to welcome them in.

“It’s you guys!” he exclaims. “Come in, come in. We weren’t sure what happened. It was the strangest thing. The occlusion of the moon—it disappeared all of a sudden! And [Eilistraee](/characters/eilistraee/) arrived in town for the festival!”

“Yes, well, we tracked down the source of the problem. A rogue priestess of Lolth was responsible,” says Harlan. “Do you know the name [Cazna](/characters/cazna/)?”

“Cazna, of course,” says Bryn. “She was the culprit? She fled the town years ago. We didn’t know she was alive! ”

“Oh, she’s dead now,” says Galadriel.

“And she was being helped by the orcs to take down Eilistraee. The followers of Shargaas, specifically,” Harlan clarifies quickly, with a glance at Hanamir.

“Well, the town is deeply in your debt,” says Bryn. “I don’t know how to thank you. Would you like a book on the History of Eillin?”

Hanamir takes it with a quick bow.

“Want to come with us to the Moon Festival?” says Galadriel. 

“We’ll buy you a drink!” says Harlan. 

“Oh! I couldn’t,” tuts Bryn. “I have so much studying to do. I would rather stay up on my hill.”

“Anything we can do for you in town?” asks Hanamir.

“Actually,” says Bryn, “there’s a wizard friend of mine who usually comes to visit me during the festival. He hasn’t come by yet, so if you see him in town, send him up my way.”

“Any distinguishing characteristics?” says Harlan.

“He’s an elf… and he’s a wizard… he’s about 700 years old… you’ll know when you see him,” says Bryn. “I really look forward to seeing him each year. He’s the only visitor I usually have, present company excluded.”

“Come on, Bryn,” wheedles Galadriel. “Science is fun and all, but you can let loose once in awhile!”

“Science is all the fun I need,” says Bryn, appearing to mean it. 

The adventurers leave this huge unbelievable nerd to his books and scamper on down the hill toward town. But before joining the festivities, they decide to seek out [Sanford](/characters/sanford/) & Son to offload their remaining orbs.

“Why aren’t you guys partying in town?” Sanford asks after greeting them as warmly as goblins can do. 

“We need some drinking money, and it so happens that we have some hot items we’d like to run by you,” says Hanamir.

“All right. Whaddya got?” asks the Son.

“Check this thing out.” Hanamir hands him the pearl orb.

“Very nice,” says Sanford, rotating it.

“There’s a trapped soul inside, too,” says Harlan. “Frost giant.”

“Trapped soul of a frost giant in a pearl… um, I’ll say three hundo for the pearl and three hundo for the frost giant.” The Son makes a note in a small ledger.

“You’ve got a deal, my man,” says Hanamir. They shake.

“Got any cool new magical items yourselves?” asks Harlan.

“Well, it really hasn’t been very long since we last saw you,” says Sanford. “It was… two days ago, I think.”

“It does not feel that way,” says Galadriel. “Anything, though?”

“We do have something you might like, adventurers such as yourselves.” He reaches into his inventory and holds up a long robe. Galadriel squints in the low light to see if it’s at all goth, but it’s not. It’s covered in colorful, oddly-shaped patches. “Interesting things happen when you remove the patches on this fashion-forward piece. You might get a helpful item for each one. Two thousand gold.”

“A little steep,” says Hanamir. “We’ll pass on it for now.”

“Anything else you want to sell, then?” 

The adventurers rummage through their belongings and produce the chalice, the bone key, the silk handkerchiefs, the gems, and the figurines they found in the tower. Sanford & Son pay them a reasonable amount of gold.

“Oh, before we go,” says Hanamir. “Can you take a look at this plane-shifting potion?”

Sanford takes the proffered vial and sniffs it, frowning deeply. “Where’d you get this? It’s very unstable.”

“Our friend drank some of this and we don’t know what happened to him,” Harlan says.

“Frankly, I would pour this on the ground, if I were you,” says Sanford.

“Really? The tiefling seemed very confident,” says Harlan.

“A tiefling gave it to you?” Sanford looks surprised.

“Yes, her name was [Magick](/characters/magick/). Making potions was her whole deal,” says Galadriel.

“Well, their names are aspirational…” says Sanford. “This potion is dangerous. Your friend drank this? How much of him plane-shifted?”

“What? He was completely gone,” says Galadriel.

“Oh, okay. That’s lucky.” Sanford raises his eyebrows and sets about packing up his new purchases. 

Harlan, Hanamir, and Galadriel laugh nervously. 

“Nice doing business with you,” says the Son. “See you around.” 

The party turns and heads toward the town.

“Oh, we’re going into town too,” says Sanford. “Haha, awkward.”

The flashback window fades from view, and you’re back with Galadriel and Buddy in the cozy TV studio. 

“Now the fun part. The adventurers head to Eillin to enjoy their success and finally let go of all that questing stress at the Moon Festival. The libations are flowing freely among the townspeople, who are making merry around a great bonfire in the center of town. I present to you the highlights of the night, in the comedic mockumentary style of The Office.”

You see a close-up window of [Frunk](/characters/frunk/) Thunderstruck, dwarf mayor of Eillin, addressing the camera directly. He’s sitting on a bench outside [Fleck](/characters/fleck/)’s Tavern. The noise of celebrants can be heard all around him.

---

“I was excited for tonight because… well, to be quite honest, this has been the most stressful couple of weeks in my life. Trying to put together this festival with this whole moon crisis going on, and not even being able to tell people about it…” Frunk rolls his eyes. “Just, let me say, I’m glad it’s over. And I’m glad I ran into those random people that day and convinced them to check out the situation with the red glass—hey, speaking of which, that’s them!” He points past the camera. “Hey! Adventurers!” He waves them over. Hanamir, Harlan, and Galadriel shuffle into the frame. Frunk tugs on the sleeve of a man standing nearby.

“[Slee](/characters/slee/)! These are the ones I was telling you about,” says Frunk.

The man, a human of about sixty years old, turns to face the party. He has a salt-and-pepper beard and a vibe of total gravitas.

“Oh my god, it’s the king,” Galadriel stage-whispers. 

“Your highness,” says Hanamir, kneeling. Harlan bows deeply and Galadriel curtsies (oh yeah, and she’s no longer dressed as a Lolth priestess and has put on a sick party outfit, by the way. Oh and it’s long-sleeved and it covers up the gauntlet). King Slee lets them express their deference for a bit of a long moment, then addresses them.

“It’s an honor to meet heroes such as yourselves. Frunk tells me that the festival would not have happened for the first time in centuries if not for your help,” says the king. “Please, tell us how you did it.”

---

The cameraman gets distracted by a very intoxicated human woman who has climbed onto a signpost and released a large quantity of flying golf-ball-sized creatures into the night air. They fly in circles and emit some impressive colored sparks for about thirty seconds. The camera pans back to our group.

---

“Anyway, we killed her exactly dead,” Galadriel is explaining animatedly to King Slee, whose brow is furrowed.

“I’m sure Eilistraee is very grateful,” he says diplomatically. “She is here tonight, you know. She likes to spend most of the festival dancing. You could go see her.”

“Oh, um.” Galadriel turns redder than a Wyrmling and glances uncomfortably at the camera for a second. She tugs at her sleeve, as if checking that the gauntlet is still hidden. “Maybe in a little while.”

“Hey, speaking of being grateful,” says Frunk, lowering his voice. “I belong to an ancient order that is charged with protecting the town. After your success on this, we’d be interested in hiring you all on a permanent basis to help defend us against outside threats.”

“We’d be open to that,” says Harlan. “Do you know anything of Regent [Khargol](/characters/khargol/)? He seems like the most likely next threat. Apparently he and the followers of Shargaas were working in conjunction with Cazna and the Lolth followers to destroy Eilistraee.”

“That surprises me. As orcs go, Khargol is pretty reasonable.” Frunk gives Hanamir an apologetic look. “He fights with honor, I mean. We have a tense relationship with the orcs of this region, and if they’re plotting against us, it might be time to break the unspoken truce.”

H’Jun strides confidently in front of the camera.

“Moon Festival forever,” he slurs. He spills some ale on himself. “HA!”

“Hey, buddy,” says Harlan. “Having fun?” 

Frunk moves away to talk with Slee, looking worried. H’Jun lumbers over to talk with the adventurers.

“Did you all see the dragon?” he whispers.

“Pardon?” says Hanamir.

“The dragon in the woods,” he says. “No one believes me.”

“Oh, um, nope, we didn’t,” says Galadriel. “But we believe you.”

“You should tell them all about the dragon!” H’Jun seems to misunderstand.

“Okay, bud.” Harlan pats him on the shoulder. “Hey, I think we met someone you know during our quest. Goes by the name of [Feld](/characters/feld/)?”

“Feld! You know Feld? Feld’s my cousin,” hiccups H’Jun. “He’s over there!” He swivels around to point at Feld and smacks an elderly half-elf in the face. 

---

The footage now cuts to a series of short interviews with partygoers, starting with the aforementioned Feld. Harlan, Hanamir, and Galadriel are present but not on camera.

---

“Oh, H’Jun? Yeah, he’s wasted again,” says Feld, shrugging. “It is what it is. He’s a good guy, and he’s letting me stay with him in town while I get back on my feet again after the kidnapping.”

He is proud to show off that he can now play Rock Me, Mama, Like a Wagon Wheel on the lute, if haltingly. 

“I got a job here in town playing live for the outdoor brunch crowd on weekends,” he says. “And I said to myself, as soon as I got it, that I’d reward you guys for saving me. Thank you so much.” He gives the adventurers some gold. What a guy!

---

The camera cuts to the interior of the tavern. Two young drow women stare at the camera, unimpressed. “She said she saw a tiefling. Yeah, here at the party. Pretty cool I guess.”

“I mean, not really. They’re just not that common around here.” The other one shrugs. “Anyway, it looked like a demon, very ugly… hated it. Smelled weird, hated it. Oh, and it kept talking about revenge! So creepy.”

“Yeah, seriously creepy.”

“It kept trying to get me to come with it to the forest or something. Like, no, idiot, there’s monsters in there. But it was talking about how it needed to head north for revenge. Toward the mountains. Against… some name… Baberuth? Babyruth? No, Bameryth.”

---

Cut to Fleck behind the bar, coin eyes glittering in the light from the bonfire outside. 

“I pretty much just serve drinks,” he says serenely. “But I did get to be part of the planning of it, yeah. And before he had to go, [the Savage](/characters/the-savage/) gave me this note to read at the celebration. I think he forgot that I… can’t anymore.” A pregnant pause. “He did say he was sorry he can’t be here for the festivities. He has business to attend to. It’s a shame, because everyone in town loves him.”

Galadriel, off camera, asks: “Any idea where he went?”

“Nah, I didn’t see him leave,” says Fleck. “But, to be fair… I don’t see anything.” He smiles at  what he thinks is the camera, but is actually the wall. “Life is hard.” The camera pans to what looks like a lot of broken glass behind the bar.

---

Back outdoors, two dwarves argue heatedly with one another. “It’s a secret dwarf treasure, that’s what makes it so cool, what is wrong with you?”

“It’s just not as cool if I can’t tell people about it, you know?”

---

Cut to a human man wearing a large purple hat and double fisting two tankards of ale. He peers into the camera conspiratorially. “I heard the orcs fled. I heard they’re really shook up, yeah. No one knows why. But my money’s on chemtrails.” 

Hanamir, off camera, expresses skepticism.

“No, really! One of my friends went out there, and... he was trying to just get a look at the forbidden city. And he had to sneak around the orc encampment to do that. And it just looked completely abandoned! Nothing inside, no clue where they’d gone. The chemtrails overhead were clear as day, though.” 

“Did your... friend... happen see any books in the orc encampment?” says Hanamir’s voice.

“My friend doesn’t like to read much,” says purple hat. “But as a matter of fact, he did see some books. But that’s even weirder. Why did orcs even have books, right?”

---

Cut to the adventurers sipping their drinks (a seltzer with lime for Hanamir, ale for the other two) near the dance floor.

---

“She’s right over there,” says Hanamir. “You could go try and make amends.”

Behind them, a twelve-foot-tall drow woman can be seen dancing in a rapturous crowd of people. She looks so much like Lolth that the cameraman does a double take—but it’s Eilistraee. 

“I don’t know,” whines Galadriel, holding her Groucho Marx disguise, weighing whether to go incognito and avoid confronting the goddess again.

“We’ll be your wingmen!” says Harlan. “If you pass up this opportunity to make things right, you probably won’t get another one.”

“Fine,” sighs Galadriel, folding up the disguise and putting it back in her bag. Harlan drags her toward the goddess.

Eilistraee notices them and stops dancing. She leaves the dance floor and approaches them.

“Greetings,” she says. If voices could glow, hers would. “I’ve been awaiting your arrival. I appreciated what you all did back there.” Despite her words, Eilistraee looks at Galadriel with a bit of side-eye. 

Galadriel sinks to her knees and bows her head. Realizing that she is not about to say anything, Harlan pipes up.

“Truly, it was our honor to help defeat Cazna,” he says.

“Yes. Did you catch it, by the way?” adds Hanamir. “It was pretty sweet.”

“The word got out,” says Eilistraee with a slight smile. “The God of Laughter is telling everybody. Truly, I owe you all my life and the life of this town.”

“Well,” says Hanamir, “we couldn’t have done it at all without our friend Galadriel here.”

“She made a great sacrifice to do what we did, to save the Moon, and we didn’t want to let tonight pass without at least acknowledging that sacrifice,” says Harlan. 

Galadriel looks up at her friends, very touched, and already ugly crying.

“May I read your thoughts?” Eilistraee asks Galadriel.

“Yes,” she sniffs. “Of course.”

“I see that you did not try to deceive me,” she says. “And I see that you are just another victim of my mother’s curse.”

Galadriel nods vigorously.

“I reacted badly before. Forgive me. You are, of course, forgiven yourself. And although there is nothing I can do to lift the curse she’s put upon you, you should know that what she said about it being permanent is not true.” Eilistraee pauses. “She aims to sow despair. But if you were to obtain the blessing of a god of her stature or higher, they would be able to lift the curse.”

“[Kord](/characters/kord/)?” asks Hanamir, glancing at Harlan.

“Kord perhaps. I don’t know for sure. One person I know could do it would be my father, Korellon, creator of the elves, who vastly outranks my mother. Unfortunately, I can’t help you with that.”

“You have already helped me.” Galadriel wipes her nose on her sleeve; it’s undignified. “Thank you.”

The goddess leans down and touches Galadriel’s head in blessing. “I think there is hope for you. I still see goodness in you. Be careful.” 

Eilistraee is silent for a moment. 

“I am going to give you a gift. It is a precious and dangerous thing to wield, and I need you to understand the gravity of it.” 

She holds a pendant. It emanates a soft light in her hand. 

“This will let you use a spell known as a Wish. When you use it, you may tell me your wish and I will grant it.”

“Why is it dangerous?” says Hanamir.

“Depending on your wish… you could level a city with it. It’s not cursed. But it will change the course of history when you decide to use it.”

“We understand. We will not take this honor lightly,” says Harlan.

“Any of you may use it, but it may only be used once.” Eilistraee hands the pendant to Galadriel. 

“It’s so beautiful,” she sobs. Eilistraee smiles.

“So, how are you feeling, godwise?” asks Hanamir as Galadriel takes a moment to collect herself. 

“I’m proud to see this festival happening. It’s unusual that I walk on this plane, but I always enjoy it. I’m glad to see the drow who have rejected my mother living here in harmony with half-elves.”

“What do you know of the orc threat?” asks Harlan.

“Shargaas is a lesser deity of the orcs, less powerful than Gruumsh, and Shargaas can’t stand that,” Eilistraee says. “He’s the god of the new moon, so we tend not to see each other.”

“Do you know what this satchel of bread is going to do to me? An evil god gave it to me.” Harlan holds up the Bread of Eternal Hunger. Eilistraee gives him a grim look.

“Just… think about where the bread comes from. There’s no such thing as free bread. Be careful with it.”

There is an uncomfortable silence while Harlan sits with this.

“By the way, Harlan’s deity Kord did aid us in saving you, just so you know,” says Hanamir. “I hope the two of you are on good terms.”

“Not all gods know each other, you know,” says Eilistraee, smirking. She walks back to the dance floor and resumes breaking it down to the slammin’ tunes.

The trio wander away from the dance floor, back to where they first chatted with Frunk and King Slee. The two leaders are standing not far off, speaking in hushed tones. Frunk looks gravely worried.

“Shall we eavesdrop?” says Hanamir.

Galadriel responds by casting invisibility on him and giving him bardic inspiration; Harlan follows up by casting enhance ability and gives him the guidance of Kord. It’s overkill, but they want to be sure.

Hanamir tiptoes up to the two leaders until he can just barely hear what they’re saying. Something about “Been”—something about unsealing a city, whether that will be necessary if someone’s gotten in—something about a betrayal—they’ll need “all the Been...”

It’s not clear what they mean yet, but that night, the adventurers discuss it as they settle into their rickety twin beds at the inn. Hanamir struggles to get his blanket to cover his whole body.

“It’s that ring with the B on it, the one the Savage has,” says Harlan. “The B must stand for Been, and if you have a ring, you’re a member.”

“So, we know Frunk and the Savage and King Slee are members,” says Hanamir. He wears an adorable nightcap and matching pajamas with little bespectacled worms reading books on them. “Who else?”

“The ring we found in the market—the one the Savage ended up buying,” says Harlan. “I think that one belonged to Uncle, right?”

“We’ll figure it out tomorrow,” yawns Galadriel. She and Buddy are spooning and already half asleep.

The flashback footage speeds up through the ensuing long rest. They sleep soundly, even with the increasingly intrusive sounds coming from outside as the sun rises on a very hungover town.

Finally, the noise wakes Harlan. He stomps over to the window groggily to see what’s causing all the ruckus. 

“Uh, guys?” he says, snapping to alertness. “There’s a sheep running around the town square knocking things over, and also the town crier is ringing a bell and saying that...Bryn is dead?”

---

This final flashback window dissolves into air. Galadriel puts down her lute and smiles.

“Ending on a cliffhanger here, I know, I know,” she says. “But join me next time for Part Two of our clip show, where we’ll see the party take on a wacky murder mystery with lots of wild animals, including a talking sheep! It’s a whole different vibe. You’ll love it!”

She places her lute in its case delicately and winks.

“This has been Galadriel T. Moonwater with your recap. Good night!”

# The True History of Eillin

## Founding & Governance

Eillin was founded in the year 325 by Veneyphe and Bynrize. Veneyphe was a Half-Elf and Bynrize was a Drow and while little is known about their history or how they came to meet it is known that they founded the town as an homage to Eillistrae and as a symbol of peace between the Drow and Half-Elves.

Eileen has little need of formal governance, the town elects an informal "mayor," the title mostly a tribute to the nickname of Venephye for the first 86 years of the town's existence. After her death there was no formal leader, but the co-founder of the town, Bynrize, served roughly the same role of settling disputes. In his old age he delegated this to an outsider and dear friend, Frunk Thunderstruck the Dwarf. This decision was made at a time of great tension between the Half-Elf and Drow populations, and eased some of the tensions.

The recent death of Bynrize leaves the young town faced with a choice, will it continue in the tradition of its now departed founders or will it forge a new path in the modern world?

## The Moon Festival

In 330, with a small population the town saw its first moon festival. On this day Ellistrae appeared in her Drow form and walked among the town and all in the town celebrated her presence. Since then she has appeared once every year while locals throw a feast in her honor.

The festival has grown so large that people come from all over to attend. In many years even the Human Rulers of nearby Aberith come to pay homage to her holiness and celebrate the beautiful spectacle of a 24-hour full moon.

## War & Peace

The history of Ellistrae has not always been peaceful, Orcs sacked the town in 389 and again in 534.

After the first raid several factions were created to defend Eillin, though they were opposed by Veneyphe as she felt that they would lead their followers to violate the town’s unspoken principle of neutrality.

Starting in 633 the southern half of the continent, which includes Eillin saw undead hordes descend on cities periodically. During this period many left Eillin to live in the city of Aberith. Eventually this led to an alliance between the two, with Aberith pledging protection in exchange for goods from Eillin. After about 50 years, the hordes eventually subsided and peace blossomed again.

The next threat that Eillin would face would nearly tear it apart. A long-extant cult of Drow made an attempt on the life of Bynrize on the eve of the moon festival. They felt that the alliance with the Half-Elf had gone on long enough and wanted to return the town to the Drow.

The leaders were defeated and their supporters were driven out of town. This led to continued strife between the Drow and Half-Elf population for many years, but that tension is mostly forgotten.

## Local Geography

Eillin is on the southern coast of Ivrend, a continent comprised primarily of Elves, Humans, and Half-Elves with the occasional Orc and Dwarf settlement. The town is bordered on the north by the anomalous “mountains of greed” a visual siren song of jewels from which it is said none return and on the south by the enchanting Moon Sea.

Surrounding the town there are several small hamlets and farms. Three main roads lead out of the town: east, west, and northeast.

To the west of the town there is a forest in which it was long rumored that evil dwelled. Young children used to play on the edge of the forest hoping to get a glimpse at the evil that lurked there but it is widely believed these were just the occasional wild animal or lost wanderer.

To the northeast there is the road that leads to the city of Aberith, the largest city on the eastern half of the continent. It is several day’s journey but some make the journey on a regular basis to trade goods in the cosmopolitan city of Aberith.

To the immediate east are the ruins of an ancient city. Not much is known about the history of the city but it is believed to have been destroyed well before the creation of Eillin. Visiting the city is banned by the Crown of Aberith.
