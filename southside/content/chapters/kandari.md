The Chillers plan to approach the center of the underground town to seek an audience with Rolan. Patrols are fairly light due to the illusory nature of the city, but there are at least nominally people who are supposed to protect the perimeter. Think the "Paul Blarts" of city keepers. [Eleazar](/characters/eleazar/) cautions the group that outsiders have never really been seen here, so we will stick out and be noticed. We could pretend to be in costume for a performance??? Or maybe just Pass Without Trace...

[Tannin](/characters/tannin/) is convinced that if there's any air in the Bag of Holding, we could transport him inside of it. [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) hates this idea. Tannin tries to sneak in anyway, but trips over himself trying to get into it.

[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) casts Pass Without Trace on the group. For an hour, we can sneak around much more stealthily. We make our way without incident to the center of the town, which is a large hollowed-out cavern. We come to the mayor's residence, where Rolan is working diligently. It's evening, but not too late yet. He is sitting with one other person we can see—his longtime assistant, Keir. Eleazar gives us the backstory: Keir is a bit more aggressive than Rolan. Rolan is widely respected, and known to be even-keeled. At times when the whole town is on alert, for instance if the illusion is threatened, Keir has always been more in favor of proactive responses.

Eleazar decides to distract Keir by showing them the book with the Infernal writing.

"Hey, Keir—I've been looking in this book since I left home, and I can't figure something out. Can you come with me and help me understand this other language?"

"I don't have much time," says Keir. "Why don't you go ask the head librarian?"

Inside the office, we can see Rolan's familiar, which is something like a bobcat.

Hanamir casts Minor Illusion, and the sound of a child's scream can be heard. Anyone within earshot runs to see what the commotion is, and Keir steps out of the office a few feet to see what's happening and make sure the townsfolk have it under control. This buys us a few minutes. We enter the office, with Eleazar using Prestidigitation to create a "Do Not Disturb" sign to hang from the doorknob.

In a large, batlike swoop, Hanamir lunges into a nearby culvert and vanishes from view. The remainder of the party troops into Rolan's office.

"Do you know what's going on out there?" says Rolan.

"It's handled," says Eleazar. "A child tried to use the aqueduct as a waterslide."

"Ah, again?" says Roland. "What brings you here?"

"Don't be alarmed, but um, I have met some friendly, good, nice outsiders."

"What?!"

"They come in peace, and they've proven that they're on our side," says Eleazar. "They have a proposition that might change the way our people live."

Rolan goes quiet. Eleazar jumps in to explain that his spellbook told him to go out into the world, and that's how he met us in the tunnels. It felt too coincidental not to be meaningful. Eleazar points at the item around Rolan's neck.

"We know the history of this thing is contentious, but we think we can find Thidror," says Eleazar.

Rolan scans the group. Harlan wears a visible marker of his alignment with [Istus](/characters/istus/), and Rolan takes note of it. His initial startled reaction turns to anger, then regains control over his expression.

"Of course. I knew that these five would be arriving. I'm so grateful that you brought them to me. For it was Istus that had helped them navigate the illusion protecting this place, and Istus who brought us together. We should all rejoice for this new beginning for our city." He cranes his neck a bit to see what's keeping Keir away so long. He addresses Harlan. "What can you tell me of the nature of your intentions?"

"As a devoted follower of Istus, I'm seeking knowledge for the purpose of bringing about harmony within this land. My companions have joined forces with me, and we seek truly to protect this world. We have other artifacts of similar power that we believe play an integral role in the current conflict amongst the gods, amongst beings from another plane, and those on this plane who seek to do harm. We're here on a mission of justice, and wish you no harm, but we believe the item you possess is of utmost importance to our mission."

"I welcome you, and beg of you not to make yourselves widely known here, at least not until Istus demands it. But of course I've been awaiting your arrival and will help you how I can. As you must be aware, removing this artifact would place this city in great danger, both from those around us as well as from the world at large."

"Eleazar has shared something of this great danger with us, but could you tell us more?" says Harlan. "In the past, we've been able to resolve some threats, so maybe we could remove the need for this protection. We understand you've been suffering under these restrictions for a long time. What's the source of the danger?"

"Many sources: the orcs and the mountain dwarves — better they think us gone than reignite the wars of the past. And of course, others who seek the artifact. One of our own kind, who was cast out, is said to wander in search of a means of retribution."

"This outcast seems to be the one you truly fear."

"Of course. But orcs, too. We've mostly disarmed in our hidden state. We know little of the current state of the world beyond the fact that we're safe and happy here. As for the outcast, there have been reports that his power has only grown. His thirst for these artifacts seems unbounded. His journals descend into madness as he believed he learned the true nature of the gods. We're not a superstitious people; we have relationships with the gods. But what he spoke of is something that would be regarded as heresy in any city. He poses a threat to the established order of things. This village only stays safe by virtue of things on the outside staying as they are. We see no reason to allow the world to be reshaped, which is his ultimate goal."

"Has he attained another of these artifacts?"

"It is said he possesses an artifact of the oldest god--the one who created the others. A vial of that god's blood, a single drop of which allows him to achieve virtual immortality." He explains that this legend comes from Tieflings.

"If we were to recover that artifact, would it have any bearing on your city?" says Harlan.

"There are those who would want to claim it as their own. We'd be much safer if it were destroyed. But if we were no longer living in fear of the outcast himself, there would be some softening of our need for protection."

"And maybe you could broker new peace with the orcs and the dwarves? Eleazar told us he pushed them away from your people."

"That is true. Before he was cast out, he was next in line to lead. But I fear that my people still might not be ready for such a change. But if he were no longer a threat, there'd be a case to be made that we could emerge from the shadows."

"Alright then, next step seems clear. Gotta beat the outcast," says Tannin.

Imprisoned or dead? We don't see a reason to keep him alive. We'd be righting a great wrong to kill him. His natural lifespan has long since expired. Rolan explains some people don't even beleive in the outcast anymore—there's no direct knoweldge of his whereabouts, just tales.

"Rolan, do any of the Tieflings who spoke with the outcast remain?" says Tannin.

Thidror, the outcast, had tried to consolidate power. He ended up setting out on his own. he heard tell of a settlement of strange beings in the southern woods. He thought maybe he could align with them or steal from them. After some time, he was sort of accepted into their settlement. These were Tieflings, and they had an unusual connection with the weave, which underlies magical power. Thidror learned a lot while he was there. Some of the Tieflings had ancient knowledge. They told a story of an elder god who had created the others, along with these artifacts. He realized his people's problems could be solved if they could just find one or two of these artifacts. He begged his father (who was in charge here) to send a party across the sea to try to find them. His father was weary of his son's thirst for power, cast him out. He made him forget his home. The mountain dwarves, however, were willing to offer him a small exploration party. He went in search of a blade that would help him banish all the orcs from this plane. He led them on an expedition, but instead of going where he said he was going, he instead took them to Teron, where this vial was apparently stored. It was there that he betrayed the dwarves. He slaughtered the party that had helped him get there. When the news of this came back to his home, that is when his father decided to seal the city entirely and prevent Thidror from returning (and remembering). He therefore left Thidror as a problem for the rest of the world. As for the Tieflings, it's not known what became of them. Presumably, Thidror would have returned there at some point... their settlement was basically due south of here.

We know that settlement... and its sole survivor. [Magick](/characters/magick/)!

Hanamir speculates that Thidror may be [The Messenger](/characters/the-messenger/). Quietly, laying in his ditch.

The idea that there is another god who created gods like Pelor and Lolth would probably be great sacrilege to followers of those gods. There are parts of this story that make a cleric (Harlan) uncomfortable, but there are also aspects that just don't make sense. It's unclear how truthful this is. It's understood that gods exist, in differing levels of power, and you align yourself with the one who embodies your ideals.

We bring up the giant automaton we stumbled upon. These are ancient dwarven machines that dot the landscape. The nature of them is not well understood by Rolan's people, but they've seen them. Wars that were waged long before even Thidror's time still scar this land. We mention the one we accidentally reactivated. Is this a problem? Only if the dwarves reactivated it for aggressive reasons.

Is there a legendary home of Thidror? No, speaking of him at all is largely taboo, other than in the context of scary stories to keep kids out of the edges of the tunnels. But there was a time that it was believed that the best defense was to keep tabs on him. Rolan thought that was too dangerous, because it might lead to him capturing someone with knowledge of the city and it might help him break the spell keeping him forgetting. There was a time when some were keeping tabs on him. Is there record of that? Rolan can give them to us.

"But sending you after him risks him capturing you and reading your minds," says Rolan. "He has no doubt attained such abilities, as his power has been growing for centuries. I would ask of you that if he captures any of you, that I'm given your word that you'd die before allowing him to search your mind. If I have your word on that, then I could part with the records, which end several decades ago, but which might give a lead on some of his activity."

We make the suicide pact. Yikes! Roland hands us the texts compiled by the small group of wizards dispatched to keep an eye on Thidror. They tracked him off-continent for awhile. He returns about eighty years ago and makes his way to Aberith. They lose track of him there. He has a few other aliases. The family name that he went by was Kandari, like Eleazar's name... and then, [Kandir](/characters/kandir/)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
