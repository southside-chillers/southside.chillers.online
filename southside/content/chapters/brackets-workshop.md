## Searching [Bracket](/characters/bracket/)’s shop

- The party decides to wait until Bracket’s shop closes and search it that night. After a cursory look around the outside of the building (and up the wall to a second-story room, in [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/)’s case), we go inside.

- When entering the shop, there’s a small noise as a glass bottle rolls to the floor. There are no other signs of life.

- We head downstairs to the workshop, finding no traps along the way.

- Cal and Galadriel search the workshop. They find many metal constructs, plans for what look like Amber Guard containment chambers, drawings of the explosives we picked up off the clowns, and drawings of what look like amulets.

- There are no secret passageways or signs of Bracket himself anywhere.

- Cal and Galadriel each take an amulet. Nothing happens.

## Confronting Bracket
- After searching the workshop, Cal and Galadriel meet up with the rest of the crew and head upstairs to the second floor.

- The containment chamber designs, along with some sealed storage crates marked with an Amber Guard insignia, lead us to believe that Bracket’s official contract is with the Amber Guard.

- In this upstairs storage room, there’s a strong sense that the party is being watched.

- Cal takes out the cube Bracket gave him and threatens, aloud, to push the button. There is no response.

- Cal takes a potion of Mind Reading and can hear Bracket’s thoughts. He is indeed hiding somewhere in the room. Bracket’s surface thoughts, at this point, are of amusement and the hope that Cal does push the button on the cube.

- Cal bluffs again and says he’ll burn down the whole shop unless Bracket shows himself. This proves to be persuasive!

Bracket appears—he was hiding in the corner, invisible, watching us. He emerges with his hands up.

- Cal says he needs Lord [Deladriel](/characters/deladriel/)’s location. Bracket, intimidated, offers to take us down to the workshop where he keeps his notes on all clients, past and present.

---

## Back to the workshop

- We go downstairs again. Bracket finds his notes on Deladriel and gives them to Cal. There’s an address where Deladriel used to stay when visiting Aberith, as well as a bill of goods purchased, which includes several metal constructs.

- Bracket asks if this is all we wanted. Cal looks at Galadriel. She starts questioning him: What do you know of the Amber Guard? The AML? Gehenna? The Sky Arrow? 

- He claims ignorance on most of these topics, but does have something to say about the Sky Arrow. He was “merely trying to study it.”

- When pressed, he confirms that [Kaz](/characters/kaz/) had possession of the Sky Arrow at one point, that it’s an ancient weapon, and that it was stolen from Kaz’s possession before the attack.

- Galadriel lets up, satisfied that Bracket is not the mastermind of the attack. 

- Cal asks what the cube does. Bracket apologizes, saying it turns into a construct that attacks the person who pressed the button. Cal keeps it.

## The Amber Guard crates

- Meanwhile, [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) sneaks back to the storage room and pries open the Amber Guard crates. Inside, he finds a variety of magical items, including four sending stones, lots of potions, a suit of armor, and a shield. 

- Hanamir loots all this and puts it in the Bag of Holding. He then runs back to meet up with [Tannin](/characters/tannin/), [Harlan](/characters/harlan/), and [Chunk](/characters/chunk/) while the questioning continues in the workshop.

## At the Half-Full Flagon

- We return that evening to our old headquarters at the Half-Full Flagon to itemize our loot and discuss our plans.

- The four sending stones are two paired sets. 

- The potions include a diminution potion (“reduce” of enlarge/reduce), six regular healing potions, six Greater Healing potions, two Superior Healing potions, two potions of fire breath, two potions of Hill Giant strength, a potion of invulnerability, and a potion of invisibility.

- The armor is a full set of demon armor. It gives the wearer the power to speak Abyssal, and it has clawed gauntlets that make your attacks particularly deadly. It’s nice armor, but it’s cursed, and you can’t take it off once you’ve put it on.

- Four magical bracelets called Bangles of Mind Shielding. These help protect the wearer from mind-altering magic. They can be made invisible, and if you die while wearing one, your soul can go inside it. Are there already souls in there? Unclear!

- The stolen amulets are linked to the constructs. It seems like they activate or control them somehow.

- We discuss our plan: to attack Kaz first? Or carry out our evidence-planting on [Odo](/characters/odo/) first? How do we resolve the two commitments we’ve made to these crime bosses? We don’t decide yet, and opt to take the opportunity for a long rest while we can.

## Rest, interrupted

- We settle in for a long rest at the Half-Full Flagon.

- But… about 2 hours in, we are attacked by Bracket’s metal constructs.

- We did rob him blind, after all. Oops!
