# Clown briefing

Cal decides to take advantage of the time before [Kaz](/characters/kaz/) returns by returning to the office to steal some platinum from the safe. During the day, however, the office is manned by "some standard person." He waits for the person to go upstairs or down to the cellar and then sneaks inside. Since we know the combination to the safe, it's easy for him to open it, steal 35 platinum, and sneak out, unseen. The missing platinum will be noticed in time, but for now, he's in the clear.

Kaz returns to the Prismatic Inn in the afternoon with a bag full of clown robes and a folio of documents. [Harlan](/characters/harlan/) eyes the bag of robes.

**Harlan:** Quite a lot of robes there. How'd you get so many?

**Kaz:** We've had encounters with some people wearing these robes. I apologize if some of them are not in the best condition.

[Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) frowns, noticing a dark stain on a robe she pulls from the bag. She doesn't recognize any of the color combinations on these robes as clowns previously encountered by the party.

Cal clears his throat, and Kaz begrudgingly makes eye contact with him.

**Cal:** I would be happy to accompany my new friends on this mission. Unfortunately, I do not think my lord would appreciate my diverting from my task without having revisited this conversation with you from earlier on about the gnome, Bracket. 

Kaz seems distracted, and singularly focused on getting the clown infiltration mission done. 

**Kaz:** Yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah. I'll make sure you get your meeting. 

We take all five robes, even though we're not sure all of us will attempt to pass as clowns. The more of us in disguise, the higher our risk of detection at this meeting. Regular attendance is usually around 15 or 20 clowns. Our initial plan is that [Tannin](/characters/tannin/), Galadriel, and Harlan will go as clowns, while [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) will lurk outside with Cal, and [Chunk](/characters/chunk/) will run messages between the two groups in ferret form.

Once we're set with our plan, Kaz tells us what he knows:

- The AML has operated in Aberith for quite a while, but it seems that there's been a change in leadership sometime in the last year or so.
- Under the new leadership, the organization changed from a bunch of disgruntled citizens with a political opinion about magic into an underground group of people who started to take... actions.
- Those who didn't like the new direction of the group defected, and that's how Kaz knows some of this. But quite a few others went along with the new direction, and have been engaging in a number of... offenses.

**Kaz:** And some of those offenses have involved stealing from *me*.

- The meeting tonight is taking place at a tavern in a neighborhood near Silver Hill known as Northgate. 
- There's a passphrase to get in. The bouncer will say "Power gave the children freedom," and the correct response is "The children destroyed life."

We ask Kaz if this passphrase has anything to do with the Messenger, since it seems oddly reminiscent of the glyphs we've discovered on the scroll so far. But Kaz claims to have no knowledge of the Messenger relating to this group in any way. He's "some crazy prophet that's been running around," but that's all. Seems fishy, maybe?

**Galadriel:** Mr. Kaz, if I may—I'm wondering what your interpretation of the motivation behind these thefts might be. Aren't these individuals who make up the AML primarily of the upper class? What need would they have to steal high value items from you? And what kinds of things have they stolen?

**Kaz:** *(sharply)* That's not why we hired you. Your job is to help us understand what they're planning and what their leadership looks like.

**Harlan:** I assume you got more than robes and locations from these people. Are there any other nicknames or passphrases we'll need to know?

**Kaz:** They refer to one another by number, which is convenient for us. I have the numbers that correspond to these robes. 

Galadriel and Harlan take the robes corresponding to numbers Forty-Two and Forty-Three, respectively. Tannin takes the robe of Fifty-Eight. The other two robes, Twenty-Six and Thirty-Three, are given to Cal and Hanamir, but they do not expect to use them.

# The tavern in Northgate

The scene: it's nearly dusk, and we're loitering outside an unassuming tavern in Northgate (the aptly-named neighborhood at Aberith's northern entrance). Those of us planning on infiltrating the meeting have donned our robes and clown makeup. Cal decides to go in and blend in with the tavern's non-clown patrons, and Hanamir disappears around a corner to lurk outside. Chunk turns into a ferret and hides in Harlan's clown robe pocket. 

Near 8 p.m., the scheduled start time of the meeting, we spot two other clowns making their way inside and toward a door in the back that leads down a set of stairs to a basement. We watch them go, and then follow at an inconspicuous distance. At the door, a slot opens up, and we hear a voice.

**Bouncer:** Power gave the children freedom.

**Galadriel:** The children destroyed life.

The bouncer opens the door, and Galadriel, Harlan, and Tannin (with Chunk stowing away) walk into the meeting room. There are maybe twelve clowns standing around, waiting for the meeting to begin, pouring themselves cups of ale. None of them appear to be in charge. We mill around and try to eavesdrop, but all the conversations we hear are mundane.

After ten minutes or so, a clown in a light blue and dark blue striped robe steps in, and everyone turns to pay attention. This clown addresses the room with the same phrase about power giving the children freedom, and the group responds in unison about the children destroying life.

**Blue Stripe Clown:** It's good to see all of you here. I know tonight is a night we've all been looking forward to for a long time. 

There are murmurs of excited agreement.

**Blue Stripe Clown:** It seems like everything is a go. We will be handing out assignments shortly, and then initiating the plan of attack.

He unrolls a large map of Aberith and taps on the area we recognize as the open-air market, and then specifically marks what we know to be the Temple of Light.

**Blue Stripe Clown:** As you know, this is our target. It will take a lot of explosives to bring down the spire—it's the tallest point in Aberith. 

He calls two clowns forward and delegates to them the task of forming two groups: a diversion group and a bombing group. Quickly, we decide to split up and listen in on both groups. Galadriel and Tannin go with the diversion group, while Harlan goes with the bombing group.

## Bombing group

The leader of this group is explaining the basics of explosives to some clowns. These are not magical explosives. He's explaining about how to light a fuse, and what to expect after that. The goal is to place as many of these bombs around the temple as possible in the hopes of bringing the entire thing down.


## Diversion group

The leader of this group explains that, despite the lack of bombs, this group is not necessarily the safe choice. The goal is to bring the heat of Aberith's Amber Guard away from the Temple of Light so that response time to the explosion is slow. He takes out a small wand, carefully wrapped in cloth, and holds it gingerly, like he's genuinely afraid of it. 

**Diversion Clown Lead:** We're going to use this to create a powerful illusion that will lure the Amber Guard to us, and then we'll ambush them.

He points to the location of the diversion, which is in a neighborhood some distance away from the Temple of Light. Someone asks about the plan for afterwards, and the Blue Stripe clown points to another location on the map.

**Blue Stripe Clown:** Yes, for those of you who are new here, we'll be meeting at our standard safe house after the attack. If all goes well, we'll have a lot to celebrate.

The leaders then begin handing out standard weapons to the clowns. At this point, Harlan takes ferret-Chunk out of his pocket and sends him to go fill in Cal and Hanamir on the situation, along with the approximate location of the safe house.

# Intervention at the Temple of Light

Hanamir and Cal receive the message from Chunk, and set out toward the Temple of Light to warn any clerics and civilians inside that they should evacuate.

Hanamir finds a Cleric of Pelor and thinks quickly.

**Hanamir:** I come as a messenger of Minister [Mirama](/characters/mirama/). The temple is under immediate threat. Tell your security to get everyone out as quickly as possible.

The cleric is bewildered by this, but is convinced by Hanamir's seriousness and urgency. They both go in to wake up any sleeping clergy—luckily, there aren't too many people in the temple at this point in the night.

# Team Distraction

Galadriel and Tannin go with the group tasked with starting a distraction. Galadriel tries, in vain, to make a point to the group leader about the hypocrisy of using magical weapons for an anti-magic cause, but this does not sway the leader. 

In a moment of impulsive desperation, she does a cool capoeira move and snatches the wand out of the leader's hand. She then bolts away toward the river. Tannin (who did not know she was going to do this!) follows after her.

---

# Team Explosives

Harlan goes toward the Temple of Light with the bombers. It's unclear if Hanamir and Cal have made it to the temple before them, or if people have gotten out safely. The Blue Stripe clown becomes agitated, looking concerned as time passes. 

**Blue Stripe Clown:** Something's gone wrong with the other group. The distraction should have happened by now. We might not have time to proceed.

In the confusion of the delay, Cal appears out of nowhere and "stumbles" into the Blue Stripe clown. He then grapples the clown's arms behind his back. There's a short, unarmed struggle, and Cal gets the sense that this individual is not quite what he seems to be—in fact, he's much tougher than a standard humanoid. We end on a cliffhanger, to roll initiative next time.
