In the morning, [Buddy](/characters/buddy/) is gone. [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) joins the other adventurers as they gather their things for the big shift to the Feywild, and puts on a brave face.

“Buddy went to stretch his wings a bit,” she says, as casually as she can muster.

“Good for him,” says [Chunk](/characters/chunk/). “I’d sit out from plane-shifting too, if I could.”

“What?” says [Harlan](/characters/harlan/). “You just became our designated plane-shifter!”

Chunk shrugs. A night of sleep has helped everyone—no one looks quite as close to their eternal reward as they did last night—but Chunk’s understanding of his new lifetime duty still seems fuzzy.

“You ready to go, [Borgrear](/characters/borgrear/)?” says [Tannin](/characters/tannin/).

“I still don’t understand,” says Borgrear. “How? How are you able to take us to the city?”

“Shh, let’s not tell him,” says [Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/). “Let’s let him see the city again first, at least.”

“But we know, right? That he failed his trials?” Tannin whispers. 

Hanamir nods solemnly.

“All right, Chunk,” says Harlan. “Let’s go.”

The adventurers link arms and, with a sensation like all five of them plus Borgrear are being braided into a rope and then unraveled, shift out of the material plane. The ramshackle old mansion disappears around them, and where the empty field once lay is an enormous walled city. 

It is a sight to behold. Like many dwarven cities, it’s carved into a mountain, but unlike any other dwarven city, it is crowned by three tall, onyx pillars connected by a network of massive vines that seethe with activity—homes carved out of giant seed pods, stems hollowed to form tunnels, and more growth and construction visible in the distance. The pillars flank the peak of the mountain like the vertices of an equilateral triangle. Between the back two pillars, there’s a large river flowing up the side of the mountain, somehow over the edge of a vine, and forming a waterfall on the other side. The physics of it seem... arbitrary. And, depending on how you look at it, it inspires either awe or severe nausea.

Borgrear, for one, has chosen awe. He is on his knees, gazing up at the city, tears flowing freely down his face. 

“Aw, bud!” says Galadriel, kneeling down to give him a little hug. “Hey, you made it! You’re back!”

“I don’t blame the guy,” says Harlan. “This is… overwhelming.”

“I thought Aberith was a big city,” says Chunk. “But this is something else.”

Hanamir, meanwhile, has stepped forward toward the city wall to inspect a simple equilateral triangle engraved there.

“Ghost king wasn’t lying about the triangle motif,” he notes. He finds the sack of Feywild leaves he collected at the trial, and shakes them loose with a contented wave. As they touch the ground, the leaves explode into little puffs of flowers like botanical fireworks. “All right, team. We’re here for the coin. Let’s enter the city and see if anyone can direct us to the king.”

He leads the party toward the gates, where two dwarves holding axes and shields stand on either side. Tannin goes to address them in Dwarvish.

“Hello,” he says. “Have you seen any strange painted clown-like fellows trying to enter the city recently?”

The two guards glance at each other and then burst out laughing.

“I dunno, Trey, have you seen a clown?”

“No. Tern, have you seen a clown?”

“No.”

“No?”

“No?”

“No?!?!”

They continue like this until they are doubled over, clutching their stomachs. Hanamir takes a full step back, and Chunk shoots a nervous glance at Harlan.

“What’s so funny?” he whispers.

“Not sure,” says Harlan. “Must be a Feywild joke.”

“At least it sounds like we’ve gotten here before the clowns,” says Galadriel.

Tannin rejoins the group huddle as the guards, Trey and Tern, continue dissolving into hysterics.

“Plan check, guys,” he says. “If everyone here is this bananas, this could be a lot harder than expected. Are we trying to steal this coin, or just make sure the clowns don’t get to it?”

“If I recall correctly, the clowns said that this coin was the key to ‘getting to King [Slee](/characters/slee/),’” says Hanamir, “and that it is critical to their schemes. I think stealing it is probably the last resort, but… we’ll do it, if we have to.”

“I bet they don’t know they’re being targeted yet,” says Galadriel. “They could be potential allies to us. So the first thing we could do is at least let them know that someone with nefarious plans is after their coin.”

“Yeah, if they can handle that concept,” says Harlan, with a glance at Trey and Tern.

“Worst case… we figure out where the coin is, and we set a *trap*...” says Tannin, procuring his trusty bear trap.

“Should we just walk in, then?” says Chunk. “Maybe find someone in a tavern who’s willing to give us directions?”

He takes the lead and walks past the two guards, who have moved on to some other hilarious topic of conversation, and who wave them through the gates without comment.

The city looks no less daunting from inside the walls. The aerial vine system is even more complex than it appeared at a distance, and every surface is thronging with activity. Borgrear, overcome with joy at finally being reunited with the city of his dreams, appears decades younger. He wishes them the best of luck and departs to explore on his own. After saying goodbye to Borgrear, the adventurers approach a few locals, first asking for directions to the nearest tavern, and then asking for directions to the palace.

“Tourists! Tourists? We don’t get tourists!” says a young dwarf man, with a mixture of excitement and alarm.

“Yeah, we want to go see the king,” says Tannin. “Where does he live?”

“The king!” the young man gasps. His face falls, and he walks away, muttering.

Hanamir tries asking someone else, a middle-aged woman.

“What? Why are you asking? You—you can’t just walk up to someone on the street and ask them about the *king*!”

“Never mind, ma’am, never mind,” says Hanamir, backing away. To the adventurers, he raises his eyebrows. “It’s like... day three of a music festival in here.”

Chunk puts on his most peaceful druidic expression and approaches a slower-moving, bushy-bearded man. 

“Hey, sir, would you mind helping out some travelers far from home?” he asks.

The man turns to him and nods, wide-eyed.

“Thank you, thank you kindly,” says Chunk. “We’ll be honest with you. We’re not from this plane, and we’re trying to find whoever’s in charge here.”

“Mmmhmm, mmhmm,” says the man, still nodding.

“What can you tell me about the king?” Chunk tries, delicately.

“The king?!” hisses the man. “The *king*?!”

“Hey, hey, shhh,” says Chunk, as if addressing a spooked farm animal. “Why does talking about the king bother you so much?”

“Where’d he go?!” the man says. He takes two giant fistfuls of his own beard and pulls it in apparent anguish.

“Is he not around?” asks Galadriel.

The man hyperventilates in response.

“All right, folks, let’s just go,” sighs Chunk.

“From what I know of Dwarvish cities, we should head for the deepest part of the mountain,” says Tannin. “Dwarf kings love being stupid deep in a mountain.”

It’s easy to get lost in the vines of the city. Sometimes, the adventures find themselves wandering the same set of shops and houses twice in a row without making any turns, as if the ground is simply rotating beneath them on a track. And, despite wandering for what feels like an hour or two, the sun remains in the same dusky position in the sky. 

Chunk relies on the intuitive power of his guardian ring to lead them through the outer sections of the city toward an area that seems much older than the rest. Instead of the chaotic, sprawling neighborhoods that were clearly built in the Feywild, or the narrow and gloomy ones that must have originated in the Shadowfell, this section of the city contains more traditional Dwarvish architecture. And at its deepest, darkest center, there is a section of hollowed-out mountain with an entire palace carved inside of it.

“Called it,” says Tannin.

A lone dwarf woman with braided hair and well-tailored robes appears in the open arched doorway. 

“Hail and well met,” she says. Her voice is sober and low-pitched. “I am [Thelatha](/characters/thelatha/). I manage the palace.”

“Hail and well met,” Hanamir repeats, offering a modest bow. “We are visitors to your beautiful city, Thelatha, and we come with an urgent message for—” He stops himself. “For whoever’s in charge.”

Thelatha eyes Chunk’s ring, and her expression betrays a subdued surprise. 

“It has been a long time since we’ve seen a guardian here,” she says. “What is the nature of this message that brings you?”

“Well,” begins Chunk, “we—my party and I—we reckon there are people that are coming to steal an artifact from you that might do serious harm to the plane where we come from.” He waits for a reaction. Receiving none, he barrels onward. “We’ve taken the trials, and now I’m a guardian here, and I wanted to come, you know, check this place out.”

“Welcome,” says Thelatha. “There are guardians’ quarters here that you are welcome to, though I’m afraid you’ll find them a bit dusty. We haven’t had a new guardian in the city in quite some time.”

“How much time do you mean?” asks Chunk.

“Since we’ve had a new guardian?” says Thelatha, frowning. “Over a hundred years.”

“Cool,” says Chunk. He claps his hands together. “Well, this should be a fun exercise for both of us.” He looks around. “Where are the other guardians? I mean… why the shortage?”

“The other guardians are…” Thelatha looks uncomfortable. “They’re not here.”

“You don’t know where they are? Or they’re dead?” says Chunk.

“They’re not here,” Thelatha repeats sternly.

“All right,” says Chunk. “So… is this where the king lives? We have an urgent message for him, like we said.”

“Oh,” says Thelatha. “Oh, of course. Yes. You can meet the king.”

“Great!” says Chunk. He bows. “You lead the way.”

“I meant tomorrow,” says Thelatha. “You can meet the king tomorrow.”

“Yeah, busy schedule, I’m sure. We understand,” says Chunk. “What time tomorrow?”

“Why don’t we say… when the sun is directly overhead,” says Thelatha.

Hanamir makes a soft “hmm” noise.

“I have a really silly question,” says Galadriel. “Sorry, tourist here. What do you call your city?”

“We just call it the City,” says Thelatha.

“Oh, neat,” says Galadriel. “Kind of like an ‘if you have to ask, you’re not one of us’ thing.”

She casts Suggestion on Thelatha, hoping to coax more details out of this unusually sober denizen of the Feywild.

“None of that, please,” says Thelatha coolly. 

“Ah, sorry about my friend here,” says Hanamir, stepping in. “We’re from—well, you probably know—and that type of thing is more socially acceptable on the material plane.” He pauses. “Where did you say we could meet the other guardians, again? Sorry, I missed that part.”

“As I believe I told your ringbearing friend, they’re out right now,” says Thelatha.

“That seems unusual,” says Hanamir. “We were told by the ghost of King Hiru the Slippery that they protect the city at all times.”

“Yes, and sometimes that involves leaving the city,” says Thelatha.

“Of course,” says Hanamir. “Well, we have a newly-minted guardian right here in our party. Should we be leaving the city as well to join the others?”

Thelatha is silent for a moment. Although she’s less easily agitated than her fellow citizens, she isn’t difficult to read, really—Hanamir gets the keen sense that she’s covering for something.

“Why don’t I first show the guardian where the guardian quarters are?” she says, making eye contact with Chunk. “I can discuss matters relating to guardianship with him personally.”

Chunk gives the other adventurers a look, and agrees to follow Thelatha down a polished corridor off of the great hall.

As soon as they’re out of earshot, Thelatha turns to Chunk, whispering urgently.

“Maybe there’s a reason you’ve been sent here,” she says. “Maybe there’s a reason a new guardian has come after all this time.” She stops, chewing on her lip. “We… we haven’t seen the king in twenty years.”

“Whoa, nelly,” says Chunk. “He disappeared?”

“The guardians are out trying to find him,” Thelatha continues.

“And when was the last time you saw them?”

“Twenty years ago,” she says. She lets out a long, shuddering sigh, as if releasing this secret has relieved a physical tension within her. “The king went out on one of his walks, and he hasn’t been seen since. Rumors have spread throughout the city, but we’ve managed to keep it under wraps… mostly.”

“People do seem a little uptight about the king,” says Chunk.

“Yes,” says Thelatha. “It’s because they know without him… we’re stuck here.”
