“Adventurers? Open up!” the voice of Frunk Thunderstruck can be heard through the door of their room. He knocks forcefully. “It’s an emergency!”

[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) leaps to the doorway like an elegant-but-burly gazelle and opens it. 

“Mayor Frunk,” he says. “We just heard about Bryn.” His voice is solemn.

“What happened?” asks [Harlan](/characters/harlan/).

“He’s dead! Murdered!” says Frunk, bustling past Hanamir into the room. “Adventurers… I cannot overstate the gravity of this situation.”

“Who did it?” [Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/) sits up groggily. 

“We don’t know, of course,” says Frunk. He snaps his fingers at her. “Wake up! This is serious!”

“Sorry,” she says. “I liked Bryn. Can we help?”

“Yes,” says Frunk. “Come with me.”

“We’ll get ready and meet you—” starts Hanamir, but Frunk interrupts him.

“No time! No time for that! I need you to help me solve the murder,” says Frunk, and he drags Hanamir out the door.

“Mayor, sir! Wait!” says Harlan, scurrying after them. Galadriel and Buddy bring up the rear, thumping down a few stairs before switching to a more coordinated spider-climb along the wall. 

The town square is in chaos: decorations from the Moon Festival litter the ground and horses sip from puddles of beer between the cobblestones. But the most prominent disruption is a sheep, bleating incessantly and knocking over barrels of trash in an apparent bid for attention. It notices the pajama-clad adventurers exiting the inn and crashes headlong into Harlan, dropping a scroll at his feet.

Harlan stumbles, then picks it up. 

“Looks like a Speak with Animals spell,” he says. “And I think through the act of reading it, it’s been cast on me, and I can—”

“Hello? Hello? Can you understand me?” bleats the sheep. Harlan glances at Hanamir and Galadriel, who look bewildered. Frunk crosses his arms, fuming at this new delay. 

“Yes,” Harlan says.

“Thank goodness,” says the sheep. “My name is Finethur Shinebright, and I’m a wizard, and I am in dire need of your aid!”

“Oh dear,” says Harlan, trying to stifle a giggle. He translates this information for his friends. “What caused your transformation?”

“I’ve been turned into this form by my traitorous apprentice. We need to go get my wand back from him. I’m afraid of what he’s doing with it,” says the sheep urgently. “He’s kept me as his prisoner for months. This has been my first opportunity to break free.”

Harlan translates again, then has a sudden realization. “Is this related to the death of your friend Bryn?”

The sheep looks on the verge of a heart attack. “Bryn is dead?!”

“Sadly, yes,” says Harlan. “We just found out. He was murdered. Stabbed to death in his observatory.” 

Shinebright baas mournfully. Buddy hops down from Galadriel’s arms and nuzzles him a bit.

“Please, follow me,” says Shinebright, after taking a moment to collect himself. “I’ll lead you to my tower and we can reclaim what he took from me.”

“Of course. Any friend of Bryn’s is a friend of ours.” Harlan explains all this to Hanamir and Galadriel.

“Hmm, I’d like to take a quick gander at the crime scene…” says Hanamir, with a gesture at Frunk, who is tapping his foot. 

“Maybe we split up?” says Galadriel, scooping Buddy up and into her backpack.

“Fine by me,” says Harlan. 

The adventurers part ways. Shinebright trots ahead of Galadriel and Harlan toward the path northward out of town, while Hanamir and Frunk head west to Bryn’s place.

—

The path up to Bryn’s observatory is blocked off by a line of thin yellow parchment reading “TAKE HEEDE! THYS YS THE SCENE OF A KYLLYNGE.” With a heavy sigh, Frunk steps over it and waves Hanamir along, trudging up the hill to the observatory. Its wide windows sparkle in the morning light.

Hanamir has always admired the observatory. He sees it as a hybrid of a temple and a library—a quiet sanctuary for a fellow man of letters. Now, as he enters the front door, he feels a level of grief that surprises him. The once-serene place is overrun with armed guardsmen poking at Bryn’s instruments and rifling through his documents. Hanamir puts on a brave face and approaches one of the guards.

“What’s the good word, gentlemen? What happened here?” he asks.

“Oh, it’s you,” a guard says, checking something on a clipboard. “Hanamore, the half-orc.”

“Hanamir,” says Hanamir.

“Sure. We were told that your party was seen departing this observatory last night. You may have been the last to see Mr. Starloft alive. Did you notice anything unusual?” asks the guard, peering up at Hanamir, clearly trying to read murderous intent in his face.

“No, but he did say he was hoping to see a friend of his, a wizard, whom he hadn’t seen in awhile. And we invited him to come to the Moon Festival with us, but he declined,” says Hanamir.

“We know he wasn’t one for parties,” says the guard, smirking a little bit. “It’s not suspicious that he stayed behind. But this is the first we’re hearing of this wizard friend.”

“Do you have any leads so far?” asks Hanamir.

“We had two intoxicated witnesses say they saw three humanoids heading out of Bryn’s place near the beginning of the festival,” the guard says, “and we know that was you and your friends. Later on, there were reports of one more humanoid seen on the path toward the observatory.” 

“Mind if I take a look around?” says Hanamir. 

“Go ahead. But we’ve searched this place top to bottom,” says the first guard. He points at Bryn’s living room, which is full of jumbled piles of books, some splayed open on the ground. 

Hanamir winces.

He excuses himself politely and circles the exterior of the observatory. Bryn’s garden is blooming with flowers and odd-looking fruits. A sheen of dew makes the surface of a large stone sundial glitter in the sunlight. Hanamir feels a swell of un-monkish anger rising in his throat. Someone so careful, so thoughtful—such a conscientious steward of knowledge—murdered! All the science, history, and magic he mastered—gone! And for what? Who could want someone like Bryn dead? And want it enough to stab him to death, in his home?

Hanamir stands where the edge of Bryn’s garden begins to slope down in a grassy hillside. Interesting. Some indentations in the soft ground here. 

“Looks like a pair of tracks,” he murmurs to himself. “Heading north… toward the mountains.”

He squints ahead at the gems that dot the distant cliffs. Whoever killed Bryn might have left these tracks. And if so, Hanamir decides, he would find them. He strides down the hill adjacent to the tracks, filled with a new sense of purpose.

—

Meanwhile, Harlan and Galadriel have followed the sheep out beyond the town walls on a road lined with tall grass and wildflowers. The morning has ripened into a beautiful afternoon. If it weren’t for the anxious chatter (or unintelligible bleating, if you’re Galadriel) of Shinebright the sheep, the adventurers might have enjoyed their stroll in the lush countryside. Galadriel tries to lighten the mood with an upbeat walking song on her lute, but Shinebright maintains his grim demeanor. 

“For many years, I lived and worked out of the tower up the road here,” he explains. “I was a transmutation wizard. People would seek me to perform polymorph spells for them, and I made a living that way.” He looks back at them impatiently, waiting for them to catch up to his four-legged scamper. “Bryn was one of my good friends, though we didn’t see each other much. Only about once a year, but that was enough for us. I’d visit him during the Moon Festival. I’m sure he was wondering why I didn’t show up this year. I hate to think that before he died, he might have felt that I’d forgotten about him—”

But Shinebright’s monologue is cut short by a sudden, piercing wolf howl coming from somewhere beyond a turn in the road next to a small thicket. A half-orc, bulkier and surlier than Hanamir, swaggers toward the group from around the bend. He is flanked by three wolves in iron collars, and behind him stomps a hulking figure in a dirty brown cloak. 

“That sheep is Master Noke’s. He desires to have it back,” says the half-orc. His hand rests on the hilt of his greatsword. 

“Well,” says Harlan levelly, “this sheep claims to be his own person.” 

“It belongs to Master Noke,” repeats the half-orc.

Shinebright backs up and circles behind Hanamir and Galadriel, visibly quaking with fear. 

“Who is Master Noke?” Galadriel pipes up, stowing her lute in its case.

“Only the best and greatest wizard and boss of all time,” says the half-orc aggressively. “Just a generous and great and tremendous and wonderful and terrific person that I love VERY much.”

“Hmm,” says Harlan.

“And he sent me to get his sheep,” says the half-orc.

“How long have you been working for him?” asks Galadriel.

“Four months, give or take,” says the half-orc. 

“Hmmmmmm,” Harlan says again, eyebrows raised.

Harlan casts Detect Magic to see if this dude is ensorcelled. He’s not. However, some other creatures are. A faint pink aura of magic appears around the three wolves and the hulking figure in the cloak. Same with Shinebright the sheep. And same with Buddy. Harlan’s eyebrows nearly pop off of his face with how intensely he’s raising them, staring at Galadriel.

“I always knew he was a special boy!” she chuckles.

“We will come back to this later,” says Harlan in a restrained tone, rolling his eyes. He turns back to the half-orc. “But sir, can I ask about your wolf compatriots here? They look fearsome.”

“They were sent to help me on my mission to bring back Master Noke’s sheep,” says the half-orc.

“Why haven’t we heard of this Master Noke, if he’s as great and powerful as you say?” says Galadriel. “You’d think the word would get out.” 

The half-orc scowls.

“Are you going to turn over the sheep or not?!” he roars.

“The sheep is a friend of a friend, so we have some responsibility to him,” says Galadriel. “He asked for our help.”

“Maybe I haven’t made myself clear. We’re here to get the sheep, and then you can be on your way. Hand over the sheep so I can return it to Master Noke.”

“What will you do for us if we give you the sheep?” asks Harlan.

Shinebright is baaing ruefully and bumping his head against Harlan’s legs. 

“Please don’t give me over to Guz,” says Shinebright, though Harlan is studiously ignoring him. “He’s Noke’s enforcer. Noke is my old apprentice. Please, please don’t give me back. I’ll be imprisoned again.”

“Hey, we’ll protect you, little guy,” says Galadriel, seeing his distress. “Don’t worry.”

“I’m an extremely powerful elven wizard!” baas Shinebright. “I’m centuries older than you!”

Galadriel smiles at him and pats his head. The half-orc, Guz, draws his sword, and his hench-animals growl. Harlan turns toward a nearby tree and emits some startling bird sounds.

“Hey, you! Bird!” the sounds, if translated, would mean. 

A small robin tilts its head to the side, surprised to hear intelligible speech coming from a human.

“Yeah?” replies the bird.

“Go find Hanamir and tell him to get over here as soon as he can,” says Harlan. “He’s a half-orc. He’ll be somewhere near the hill with the observatory on it, just outside town.”

“Okay, but you owe me,” chirps the bird. It flutters off.

Harlan nods at it and then swiftly casts Shatter on Guz, smacking him to the ground with thunder damage. The hood of the ratty cloak on the hulking creature behind him falls off, revealing a bear. Galadriel nocks an arrow and shoots the bear in its shoulder. It makes a pitiful noise and lumbers off to climb the nearby tree.

One of the wolves approaches Harlan, snarling and snapping. Harlan brings down his hammer in a brutally effective swing and crushes the wolf’s skull. He then casts Thunderwave and a second wolf is killed instantly. 

Just then, Hanamir bursts in on the scene from seemingly out of nowhere—that guy sure is sneaky! The bird circles above him, and Harlan hears its majestic cry: 

“Breadcrumbs… you owe me breadcrumbs now… toasted sourdough if you have it…” 

“Good thing I have bread,” says Harlan to himself, darkly. 

Hanamir leaps at Guz and they cross swords, neither landing a hit, but giving Harlan time to think. The bear still sits in the tree, licking its arrow wound. It doesn’t look particularly threatening. Nevertheless, Harlan casts Command on it, telling it to leave, and it acquiesces, trundling off toward a larger thicket of trees.

“We’ll offer you a deal,” says Galadriel, watching as Guz pushes Hanamir away from him. “There are three of us now against you and one wolf. We’ll let you live if you go on your way, and the sheep stays with us.”

“It’s a good deal, brother,” adds Hanamir in Orcish, and then in Common, “you’ll want to think about it.”

Guz does think about it, and then decides to continue fighting. 

The last wolf pounces on Shinebright and grabs him by the scruff of his wooly neck. In response, Galadriel casts her trademark Tasha’s Hideous Laughter on the wolf. It lets go of Shinebright, falling to the ground and barking with hilarity. Shinebright flees to stand behind Galadriel. She approaches the laughing wolf and stabs it in the neck with her short sword, killing it.

Harlan joins Hanamir in his battle against Guz, knocking him to the ground with his maul, and then Hanamir deals the final blow. Guz is dead.

“Oh, thank you,” bleats Shinebright. “Thank you kindly. As you can see, I’m doomed without your help. Noke has many other transmuted guards who work for him, and eventually, they will find me. The only way I’ll be safe is if we go and retrieve my wand from him.”

Harlan translates.

“We trust you,” says Galadriel. “Do you mind telling us how he got your wand?”

“I have an incredibly rare wand of true polymorph,” says Shinebright. “One fateful night, I ended my wizard’s trance, and I found my apprentice standing above me. He was clutching my wand. I demanded to know what the boy was doing, but the only noise I could produce…” He pauses for a moment to gather himself, or just for dramatic effect. “I could only baa.” He demonstrates pitifully. “So he kept me in the garden for months, and I only ate grass and buttercups, and he kept me contained by hungry wolves and other beasts that he had polymorphed. He was terrified of my escaping. He stole my life! He told everyone I had died and that he was my successor. He began doing polymorph magic for anyone who needed it, just like me.”

“Were there any warning signs? Did you suspect him of resenting you during his training?” asks Harlan, after relating this expository baa-ackstory to his friends.

“Well…” says Shinebright. “He was always frustrated with me. He’s human, and humans are impatient. I would always tell him ‘You’re still young! Don’t worry about it,’ and, you know… maybe it had been sixty or so years. But I’m an elf, and that’s not a very long time.” 

“Are you familiar with the human lifespan?” says Harlan earnestly.

“It’s hard to remember! I’m not a zoologist,” says Shinebright. “He wasn’t ready to wield a wand. I was teaching him the way I was taught. He was just impatient, and I told him to wait, and he didn’t like that.”

“So when you say ‘boy’, you really mean he was an elderly man?” prompts Galadriel.

“He was seventy, at most!” bleats Shinebright.

“I see,” says Galadriel, and she can’t help but laugh. She casts Zone of Truth. “I hope you understand this is just a precaution. We’ve been hurt before, and, well, I’d just like it if you would repeat the story you just recounted for us while this spell is in effect.”

Shinebright repeats his story faithfully, but sounds guiltier this time. He knows he was a bad teacher.

“All right,” says Harlan, sighing. “So we head to the tower next. What of Guz and his wolves?” The messenger bird has returned and is sitting on Harlan’s shoulder, demanding breadcrumbs. Harlan rummages in the Eternal Hunger satchel and procures a few bread nubbins. The bird eats them and its plumage grows fuller and shinier instantly. It trills happily and flies away.

“I guess let’s find out what the wolves really are,” says Galadriel. She takes the collars off the wolves, expecting them to shift back to their original un-polymorphed forms, but nothing happens. She puts one collar around Buddy’s neck and fashions him a little name tag, though, and it’s cute.

Hanamir inspects Guz’s corpse. He doesn’t have much of value on him, but he is wearing a pretty neat pair of denim jorts. Hanamir decides to take those. “These’ll be great for summertime,” he says, sounding excited. “And they’re in my size!”

Harlan now takes the opportunity to address Buddy, who is snorting and sniffing the grass. He still shimmers with an arcane aura from Harlan’s Detect Magic spell.

“Buddy,” he says, “we haven’t spoken up until now. Would you do us the favor of—”

“Ask him if he loves me!” giggles Galadriel. 

“We’ll—um, we’ll get there. Would you do us the favor of—”

“It’s okay, I know he does,” she grins.

“Ahem,” says Harlan. “Would you do us the favor of introducing yourself, now that I can understand you?” 

Buddy oinks, blinking at him. 

“We know very well that you are not a pig, although you are very cute,” he says carefully. “We have no desire to tear you away from Galadriel; I can see you’ve become very attached. But I need you to speak to me.” 

Buddy oinks again. He plucks a piece of clover and nibbles on it. Galadriel coos.

“Come on. Aren’t you curious?” Harlan turns to Galadriel. 

“I feel like when Buddy wants me to know who he is, he’ll let me know in his own time,” she shrugs.

“So you’re not worried that Peter Pettigrew is pulling one over on you?” says Harlan.

“I don’t understand that reference,” says Galadriel. “But no, I’m not worried. He’s been good to me.” She pauses and remembers that Zone of Truth is still active. “Hey, you still want to eat him?”

“I do enjoy the taste of bacon,” says Harlan. “But I’m more concerned for our safety in the presence of Buddy than I am interested in eating him.”

“Fair enough,” says Galadriel. 

Shinebright nudges Harlan, who is still squatting in the grass trying to engage Buddy. 

“I’ll transmute this pig for you as soon as you get me my wand back!” he offers. 

“I’d be interested in that,” says Harlan. “Can you identify its true form?”

“Not yet. I’d need my wand. But yes.”

“Sounds like it’s up to you, Gals,” says Hanamir.

“I won’t force him to reveal himself,” she maintains. “I don’t care what his true form is. I love him so much.”

“What if—what if Shinebright whispered in my ear what his true form is, once we get his wand back?” says Harlan. “And that way I can be satisfied in knowing he’s not a threat, if he isn’t. But if he is, we take action.”

“Yeah, Gals,” says Hanamir. “I gotta tell you. I don’t want to kill your pig. But if he proves to be a danger, I will.”

“That is fair,” says Galadriel. “I don’t approve of anyone who would try to harm my companions. But I honestly believe Buddy has been one of those companions—a friend to us all. We don’t know why he changed forms, whether he’s in hiding, or whether it was even his choice. I don’t want to force him to do anything he’s uncomfortable with. But if it turns out…” she trails off, shaking her head. “I trust you two to do what’s right. You know that.”

During this chat, Shinebright has wandered off to eat buttercups. He saunters back when he senses the drama has reached a conclusion. 

“You guys done?” he asks. “Cool. So, the tower. There are three platforms. The lowest is a garden, the middle is the main living area, with a library and my workshop. The tallest platform is my bedroom. There are guards surrounding the tower—at least one more bear, and I don’t know what else.”

Once they are in sight of the tower, they decide to take a long rest. However, they do not hide themselves well enough, and a group of apes acting as guards discover their campsite. The guards subdue them and bring them to the garden platform of the tower. A man’s silhouette appears in the window of the tallest platform above them.

“I’ll take it from here,” says the shadow to the ape guards, and they leave. He then addresses the adventurers. “Greetings, trespassers. It appears you have something of mine. Give it back.”

“It is our understanding that you wrongfully transmuted a wizard, Finethur Shinebright, into this sheep,” says Harlan.

“Wrongfully? Hah!” says the man in the window. His face comes into the light, and he is indeed an elderly man. “Shinebright was my hero. I dreamed of studying under him. And I did—for decades! And he treated me like a child. Always said I wasn’t ready. All he ever let me do was cook and clean and recite answers from books! I’m old now. I had to stand up to him.” He clears his throat, apparently to shake off his feelings. “He wasn’t even a good wizard, I learned. He just had this wand. So yes, I took it from him, and I turned him into a sheep. I’m doing what he used to do, and I’m doing it better!”

While he speaks, Hanamir sneaks closer to the door and starts fiddling with the lock. 

“I’m sympathetic to your story,” says Harlan. “I’m a human myself. There is no question that you were wronged. But you sent your goon to kill us—he was ready to slaughter us in cold blood over this sheep. We cannot condone this wanton use of deadly force, nor the unchecked release of transmuted animals to do your bidding. So, I propose an alternative: you keep the sheep and everything in the tower, and we take the wand.”

Noke doesn’t say anything. Harlan continues.

“We take it to the King of Aberith, and ensure that it is stored in a safe place, and never used by anyone again.”

“No deal,” says Noke, finally. “I am nothing without the wand. I’m an old man who never learned much magic. But the wand makes me powerful. I’ll give you the tower if you let me keep the wand.”

“And the sheep?” says Galadriel.

“I also get to keep the sheep,” says Noke.

“No offense, but this seems like kind of a shitty deal,” says Galadriel. 

“Well, it is a pretty nice structure. Good tall tower, interesting layout,” considers Harlan. 

“That’s just not what I’m out here for,” says Galadriel, “you know? We told the sheep we’d protect him.”

“I do not plan to slaughter the sheep,” clarifies Noke. “All I want is to see Shinebright live out the rest of his years stripped of his power. Knowing that I took everything from him.”

“Well, what about your ambition?” says Harlan. “You say that’s all you want, but…”

“Oh, yeah, well I also want to get rich by doing spells of true polymorph for people.”

“Mmhmm, mmhmm,” says Harlan. Hanamir is very close to figuring out the lock. Harlan stalls for time. “Would you mind showing us the wand?”

Noke holds it up. It has several odd-looking pieces grafted onto it, and it is sparking and fizzing in a way that makes everyone instantly uncomfortable. 

“Whoa,” says Harlan. “I do not think you should be using that wand.”

With a click, Hanamir succeeds at picking the lock. The door swings open. Galadriel immediately casts Invisibility on herself. Noke casts Thunderwave and blasts Hanamir backward, inflicting some damage. Noke also casts Slowness on the party, but Galadriel dodges it. 

The party enters Noke’s living quarters. In a rush of flapping sheets and snapping bedposts, they see that the wizard has transmuted his bed into a Wyrmling dragon.

Commercial break. Grainy black-and-white footage of a female gnome in a kitchen, looking bored, sighing inaudibly. 

“Are you TIRED of your USUAL household objects and REGULAR possessions?”

The gnome holds up a nondescript wooden spoon and sighs again.

“Do you wish that something you own… was actually something ELSE?”

The gnome nods eagerly, then holds her arms in a shrug, as if to say: “But how?!”

“Take that plain old item from drab to fab with the help of transmutation wizard Finethur Shinebright!” 

A puff of magical pink smoke obscures the wooden spoon, and, in an instant, the gnome is holding a live owl the size of her entire torso. She is thrilled, but topples under its weight, and the owl flaps its wings in distress. A slickly-designed logo appears overtop of the scene, reading SHINEBRIGHT: POLYMORPHING SINCE THE REIGN OF GERIL II.

“Shinebright! He’ll polymorph anything into anything else, at a price that you won’t BELIEVE. Conveniently located on route 2 north out of Eillin.”
