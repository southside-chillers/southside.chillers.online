# [Harlan](/characters/harlan/)'s dream

After Harlan's resurrection, still in the Shadowfell, we take a long rest. It’s finally restorative of spell slots! Whew.

Harlan dreams: he’s back in the sacred cave he once protected. It’s storming outside. He’s had this dream before. But then the wind slows, and the rain parts like a curtain. The cave is just a cave again. 

He hears a soft, musical voice. “That was never your fate.” 

A short and slender woman, ageless, appears before him. She says, “They call me [Istus](/characters/istus/)." 

Harlan knows of her—this is the goddess of fate, who rules over the knowledge domain. 

She continues: "A mysterious force is at work. Things long at rest have started to move. The gods themselves are threatened, and the threads of fate grow short for some of them. The devout are dying across the planes. In turn for your allegiance, I offer you my blessing.” 

After his death, Harlan has emerged more cautious and reserved. Before, he used to think he could be reckless and foolish, and [Kord](/characters/kord/) would protect him. Now he realizes that was a fiction. If he can be killed so easily, he really can’t depend on Kord for very much at all. 

So to protect himself, he longs to know the will of fate, to have knowledge that might serve as a shield. He accept’s Istus’s offering, and becomes her cleric. He beseeches her for any warning of immediate danger; he feels responsible for himself and his party, to keep them from harm. 

**Istus:** Your current state is a difficult one. You were struck down by a shadow dragon—a dragon that lost its true form from too much time in the Shadowfell, succumbing to madness. It desires a coin taken from its hoard long ago. It pursued this coin across the planes, and was eventually stuck in the oblivion that swallowed it. The dragon still seeks the coin. For some reason it thought you in possession of it.

**Harlan:** So I must go away from this place, or otherwise kill the dragon. What would you advise I do?

Istus ponders this for a second. She has thread twirled around her fingers and performs a cat's-cradle with it while she thinks.

**Istus:** It’s not clear that you need to kill the dragon. It is a lost creature, and if it needs to be slain, then you will. But it’s not… key to your fate. I think you know that there are larger threats looming. Maybe not to you, but to the fate of all. To all the planes.

Harlan thanks her, and vows his allegiance.

# The new Harlan

Harlan's alignment is now Neutral Good.

- He is generally more willing to abide by rules now. 
- He doesn’t have a holy symbol of Istus yet, but no longer wears his Kord symbol.

**[Tannin](/characters/tannin/):** So, you’re a nerd now?

**Harlan:** A knowledge domain cleric, yes. Hopefully to keep us all from imminent death.

**[Galadriel](/characters/galadriel/):** Nerd alert!!!

- She is clearly glad to see him alive and well, but her interactions with him are full of some forced-seeming nonchalance, like she's maybe a little embarrassed by her outpouring of emotion.
- Harlan himself is still a little withdrawn. It's hard trying to cope with your own death and rebirth, and some of his memories are not quite all there.
- Tannin tells Harlan about his old self, with Tannin-esque embellishments: "you could fly on the clouds! You could part the seas and eat lightning!"

Tannin still wants to kill the dragon that killed Harlan; he thinks it would be a service to the city *and* very satisfying for the party. Galadriel is not feeling it.

**Tannin:** So you’re going to sleep well tonight knowing the thing that killed Harlan is still out there?

**Galadriel:** My advice? Tell King Kolme to flip the coin until he gets back to the material plane, and then stay there. It’s not safe in the Feywild; it's clearly not safe in the Shadowfell—all of this is stupid and none of it is worth it.

When asked, [Thelatha](/characters/thelatha/) denies that the city stole the coin from a dragon’s hoard in the first place. She backpedals a little, saying if it *was* stolen, it was so long ago that no one remembers.

# Snowmantle Estate smackdown

The next morning, we use [Chunk](/characters/chunk/)’s guardian ring to come back to the material plane. [Borgrear](/characters/borgrear/)'s house and the barren field are just as we left them, except without the coating of frost. 

- Discussion: can we add this to our property empire?
- We'd need a caretaker to keep the field clear. Is this Chunk’s job now? Can we move either [Tord](/characters/tord/) or [H'Jun](/characters/hjun/) from the [Shinebright](/characters/shinebright/) Tower over here?
- Who will take care of Borgrear's dogs? It’s a remote place. Will they be okay?
- (We assume they're pretty self-sufficient.) 

As this conversation winds down, we hear some ominous goofy laughter in the distance. There are clowns in the field! Two of them! One is dressed in white and pink robes, and the other in purple and yellow. We’ve never seen these colors before. They stand a substantial distance away from us, and they do not seem to have noticed us yet. 

**Galadriel:** Are these more fox people? I don't know if we can take two of them.

[Hanamir](/characters/hanamir/) casts Pass Without Trace in order to buy the party some time.

**Chunk:** Do we want to question them, or just attack? We know they're bad, right? 

**Tannin:** Yeah, the only good clown is a dead clown.

**Galadriel:** We know why they’re here. They’re trying to get the coin, and we can’t let them do that. I'm going to pre-emptively turn into a giant ape.

She casts Polymorph and transforms into a massive primate. Thanks to Pass Without Trace, the party still gets the jump on the two clowns, who don't notice us until we're already attacking them.

### Purple and Yellow
- Tannin is up first. He goes into a reckless attack and hits the purple and yellow clown. 
- Hanamir attacks next and makes several hits on the same clown for 32 damage total.
- The purple and yellow clown, in reaction to its injuries, starts to grow, eventually busting out of its robe. It reveals its true form: one of those metallic bug soldiers, which Galadriel recognizes from the Gehenna army!
- Unable to convey this to her comrades except in primal grunts, Galadriel as an ape punches the bug creature and crushes it into jelly. She beats her chest and roars.

### Pink and White 
- Harlan is without magic at the moment, so he just swings his hammer at the remaining clown in white and pink robes. 
- It, too, begins to change shape, but into something different: a tall, green, ogre-like creature. (SHREK???)
- On Chunk's turn, he uses his Druid shapeshifting ability to become a normal-sized ape. He punches the clown just as it completes its transformation into a 15-foot-tall Shrek. 
- The Shrek blasts everyone backwards and knocks them prone, except for Galadriel in giant ape form. It stares at her. She roars at it. It attacks her for 27 damage, and she also fails a CON save, resulting in an infected, oozing wound.
- Tannin and Hanamir resume their multi-attacks on the Shrek, doing considerable damage, and Galadriel punches it. At one point, Tannin rolls double nat 20s.
- The Shrek claw-attacks Hanamir. 
- Harlan does more damage to it with his hammer.
- Does the Shrek want to say anything to us? No, not really. It's just here to fight.
- Galadriel rolls a nat 20 to punch it one last time, and it's entirely smushed.

# Onward to Aberith

Galadriel dismisses Polymorph and comes back to herself. She still has the oozing wound, but Chunk performs a basic medicine check and heals her.

**Harlan:** Can we search the bodies? Is there anything left to search?

Their robes are in tatters, but we dig through them. In the purple and yellow robes, we do find: 

- a map! It depicts a path from Aberith to the current location.
- a scroll written in a language we can’t understand. 

Galadriel casts Comprehend Languages. It’s written in Abyssal. The scroll contains instructions: 

- These clowns were ordered to go to this location and wait. 
- It contains a description of several of us. They were here to find and fight us.
- They’re not used to describing humanoids, so the descriptions are kind of vague. We have fun figuring out which of us is which. 
- "Kill or capture if possible, but most importantly, bring back the quiznos." 

Hanamir points the Mirror of the Past at the biggest piece of a clown he can find. He sees:

- It’s among hundreds of its own kind (the bug), in an army like formation. 
- It came to the material plane only recently. 
- It was trained as a soldier, plucked out of lineup, and given these orders.
- The life it led was geared toward war, not a lot of individual experiences there.

The next day, he points the Mirror at a piece of the Shrek—this is a more rare creature, apparently, with a higher rank among the Gehennans. He was personally handed the orders. The orders themselves were written by the blue and purple clown, the one who survived and escaped the safe house fight detailed in [Chapter 45](chapters/fire-in-the-kiln/).

As we approach Aberith, there’s a military garrison around the perimeter. A small force of a couple hundred individuals is protecting the city. Some time has passed; this is a significant change from what we remember.
